We should not see the drop in income share that we see here with the top 5%.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0 c2"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">The vast majority of what drives this discrepancy given the generally progressive income tax structure are the regressive sales and excise taxes and property taxes. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0 c2"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">To improve it, I think we can keep in mind a few things.

Do you believe charters should be subject to FOIA? How would you resolve these opposing stances on charter school transparency?</span></li></ol><p class="c3"><span class="c0">- Charter schools absolutely should be subject to FOIA and open government laws. They are publicly funded institutions and should be subject to the same transparency rules as DCPS. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If this requires a change in the funding model, I would be open to consider that, though I&rsquo;d like to see real evidence of a need.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h2 class="c13 c22"><span class="c0 c2"></span></h2><h2 class="c13"><span class="c1">HOUSING</span></h2><p class="c3"><span class="c0">4.

If not, explain where you differ. What other ideas would you propose to help residents who are negatively impacted by rising rents?</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0 c5">-</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;I support a number of the reforms, but I can&rsquo;t commit to the platform in its entirety at this time. My stances on a number of the proposals:</span></p><p class="c3 c18 c4"><span class="c0">- I support eliminating vacancy increases, which I believe encourage predatory landlord practices.</span></p><p class="c3 c27"><span class="c0">- I support eliminator voluntary agreements, which I believe encourage predatory landlord practices.</span></p><p class="c3 c18 c4"><span class="c0">- I support the CPI+0% rate increase reform.</span></p><p class="c3 c4 c18"><span class="c0">- I support the restriction on the frequency of rent increases.</span></p><p class="c3 c27"><span class="c0">- I support the stronger audits of landlord petitions, and the capital reserve and housing code compliance requirements.</span></p><p class="c3 c18 c4"><span class="c0">- I support the listed restrictions on capital improvement petitions.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0">- Further, I support efforts to increase enforcement of habitable living standards. I support increasing the number of housing inspectors and ensuring that the Attorney General&rsquo;s office has sufficient staffing to pursue landlords who are not maintaining their properties in habitable conditions.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0">- On the other items, I&rsquo;d like to see additional information on the possible impacts as I&rsquo;d be concerned about their long-term impact to housing in the District. It&rsquo;s essential that we approach this correctly and do not create unintended consequences that future generations need to resolve.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">5. Our public housing tenants are facing a serious crisis, and we have little confidence in the DC Housing Authority&rsquo;s plan to &ldquo;reposition&rdquo; public housing.

What other policies would you propose to protect and/or expand public housing and housing for very low-income residents in DC?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0 c2"></span></p><p class="c8 c4"><span class="c0 c5">- </span><span class="c0">I have signed the petition. Given the massive scale of the problem, I think our best path forward is a build-first replacement model with mixed-income developments that at a minimum retain the affordability makeup of what&rsquo;s being replaced. The affordability of the replacement development should be guaranteed in perpetuity.</span></p><p class="c6 c4"><span class="c0 c2"></span></p><p class="c8 c4"><span class="c0">With the replacement developments being mixed income, I think this also helps ensure that we&rsquo;re never in a situation like we are today, where the problems have been ignored for decades and many people are living in truly deplorable conditions.</span></p><p class="c6 c4"><span class="c0 c2"></span></p><p class="c8 c4"><span class="c0">- Other policies I support would be efforts to increase housing production and require or encourage a greater portion of that to be dedicated to low- and middle-income housing. Job growth in the District continues to drastically outpace housing growth, and we need to address that disparity and make up for the decades of pushing out low income residents.</span></p><h2 class="c13"><span class="c1">GOVERNMENT/ETHICS</span></h2><p class="c3"><span class="c0">6. Are you participating in Fair Elections? If not, why not? What other ideas would you propose to limit the influence of money in politics?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Yes, I&rsquo;m participating in Fair Elections.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0">- Other ideas would be a reform of the ethics rules that Jack Evans has clearly taken advantage of, such as banning outside income or putting in clear rules around transparency and conflict of interest disclosures.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0">- I think election reforms such as ranked or star choice voting are also improvements that we can make to encourage responsiveness to voters.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">7. Do you support abolishing Constituent Service Funds and replacing them with appropriated funds to serve resident needs? If not, explain.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Absolutely.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">8.

Since DC frequently has races with many candidates in which the winner gets far less than a majority of the votes, would you support implementing ranked choice voting or some other method to ensure some level of majority support?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Yes.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">10. What role the does DC Council play during the Ballot initiative process? </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0">- I think they can play a part in the public conversation of whether it is a good idea to pass or not. I do not support repealing laws or initiatives that voters have passed.</span></p><h2 class="c13"><span class="c1">CRIMINAL JUSTICE</span></h2><p class="c3"><span class="c0">11. Do you support decriminalizing sex work? If not, explain how you would reduce the violence and exploitation currently suffered by these workers?</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0">- Absolutely. It&rsquo;s clear that what we&rsquo;re doing today harms the most vulnerable among us when we need to be protecting and aiding them.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">12. Do you support ending stop and frisk in DC?</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0">- Absolutely. It&rsquo;s a human rights violation and the practice needs to end. As someone with family members who have been police officers, I think I can be a particularly strong force for abolishing the practice and encouraging better policing practices. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">13. What public health policy ideas would you propose to reduce violence in DC?</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0">- I strongly support expansion of the violence interrupter work under ONSE and the AG&rsquo;s Cure the Streets program.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0">- We need to ensure people are healthy and have food to eat.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0">- We need to expand mental health services, particularly in our schools.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0">- We need to consider the various factors that lead to violence. We need to provide hope and options to people. We need to provide job training and skill development. We need to ensure our children have a safe and positive environment to learn in.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0">As we discuss how we make progress, I think it&rsquo;s important to have elected officials who understand the challenges people face and how they end up on these paths to crime and violence (in addition to the things that should not be crimes). </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0">I grew up with some that managed to escape poverty and violence, and some that didn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ve lost people to substance abuse, suicide and gun violence. I have deep, personal experience with the issues we need to address and overcome. I believe this experience will be immensely valuable as we seek to improve the lives of our residents.</span></p><h2 class="c13"><span class="c1">IMMIGRATION</span></h2><p class="c8"><span class="c0">14. Do you support legislation to prohibit the District from cooperating with federal immigration agencies, including by complying with detainer requests, absent a judicial warrant or order?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0 c2"></span></p><p class="c8 c18"><span class="c0">- Yes, absolutely.</span></p><h2 class="c13"><span class="c1">ENVIRONMENT</span></h2><p class="c3"><span class="c0">15. Given Pepco&rsquo;s resistance to transitioning to clean renewable energy, do you think DC would benefit from municipally owned electricity? If not, why?</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0">- Definitely! Electrical supply is a natural monopoly, and any service that is a natural monopoly we need to consider municipal ownership or other reforms or requirements of private service.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0">People must buy power service and we need to ensure there are no predatory practices taking advantage of the lack of competition. There are clear advantages to the provider being an organization that has a commitment to service and the public rather than profit and investors.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0">My favorite example of this is the Chattanooga Electric Power Board (EPB), which is one of the top-rated utilities by consumers in the country according to Consumer Reports.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0">In addition to their excellently rated electricity service, when Chattanooga was facing serious issues of Broadband Internet access from the incumbent Internet Service Provider (ISP), the EPB stepped up and provided fiber internet service to their service area, which is also rated extremely well.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0">This is an excellent example of what&rsquo;s possible when there&rsquo;s a commitment to the public rather than profits.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">16. What specific legislative initiatives will you introduce in Council Period 24 to protect DC from the effects of climate change?</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0">- I will push for legal adoption of the MoveDC plan. Greater bus, bicycle, and transit usage will help reduce greenhouse gas usage in the District.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0">- I will further support efforts to ensure our construction and land management is climate resilient.</span></p><p class="c3 c4 c11"><span class="c0 c2"></span></p><h2 class="c13"><span class="c1">HEALTH</span></h2><p class="c8"><span class="c0">17. The DC Council passed the landmark &ldquo;Birth to Three&rdquo; legislation providing universal child care at subsidized rates; however, they failed to fully fund it. Would solutions would you propose to create sustainable funding for the program?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0 c2"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- I&rsquo;d like to start with evaluating DC FPI&rsquo;s Mansion Tax proposal.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0 c2"></span></p><p class="c8 c4"><span class="c0">- I also support a thorough review of our tax expenditure programs. An initial rule here could be to only support tax expenditures that the DC CFO deems beneficial to the District and an economically good idea. Unnecessary tax subsidies are too often given to corporations.</span></p><p class="c6 c4"><span class="c0 c2"></span></p><p class="c8 c4"><span class="c0">- As we discuss full funding of the legislation, we should also understand and evaluate the economic benefits of early childhood assistance. I believe legislation like this provides a long-term cost reduction to the government as well as unlock economic potential, leaving more money for consumer spending and greater possibility for both parents to be able to afford to work.</span></p><h2 class="c13"><span class="c1">BACKGROUND</span></h2><p class="c3"><span class="c0">18. </span><span class="c0 c20">(Ward 2 challengers only)</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Are you committed to removing the incumbent from office? If yes, what criteria should be used to determine who is the best candidate to challenge him?</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0">- Yes. I think voters should determine who they think is the best person to improve DC. In the presidential primary, my criteria is who I think is the best candidate to move our country forward.

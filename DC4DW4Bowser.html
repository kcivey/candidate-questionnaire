Do you think this is a fair tax structure? If so, explain why. If not, explain why and how you would improve it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c7">I believe this tax structure is unfair and should be more progressive putting greater tax burden on residents who have greater overall means to afford the taxes. &nbsp;I will advocate taxing individuals who earn between $10k and $40k at 5.5% marginal rate; those who earn $40k and $60k at the 6% marginal rate; those who earn up to $150K at the 6.5% marginal rate; those who earn up to $350k at 8.5% marginal rate; and those who earn more than $350k at 8.95% marginal rate. &nbsp;I will advocate reducing the estate tax exemption down to at least $2 million so that estates are taxed above that amount and eliminating the exemption on taxing mutual funds and other passive investment vehicles.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><h2 class="c3" id="h.3znysh7"><span class="c1">WORKERS&rsquo; RIGHTS</span></h2><p class="c6"><span class="c4">2. DC has a proud history of passing landmark labor laws but a lackluster record of enforcing these laws or proactively informing workers about existing or new rights. What will you do as a CM to change this status quo and ensure there is strong oversight &amp; enforcement of worker rights?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c7">I would implement a public service campaign using DC TV and using all government recreation centers, senior centers, and public schools to inform residents about their rights under federal and DC anti-discrimination laws, labor laws, wage and hour laws, DC sick leave laws, and federal family and medical leave law, and DC paid family leave. &nbsp;I will advocate legislation to require employers to give notice to employees after hire in their paychecks (if paid electronically, to send by mail) and whenever a change of status causes any change in rights with regard to sick leave, family leave, wage and hour, and other employment rights. &nbsp;I will advocate legislation to require employers to conduct annual training of supervisors who impact these worker rights. &nbsp;Additionally, I will highlight enforcement against wage theft, including focusing on the restaurant industry which DC Employment Services found to be the highest wage theft industry in DC. &nbsp;I will introduce legislation to transform the corrupt tipped wage system by making DC an equal wage jurisdiction. &nbsp;I will advocate for a study to determine whether drivers of Uber, Lyft, and similar companies are statutory employees and, if so, advocate legislation to treat them as statutory employees. &nbsp;I will advocate comprehensive clawback legislation which would require any business receiving public funding to give back public money and pay a penalty for misusing the funding for violation of the labor laws. &nbsp;I will fully support swift passage of the Domestic Workers Protection Act of 2019 to extend wage and hour and anti-discrimination laws to domestic workers including live-in workers.</span></p><h2 class="c3" id="h.2et92p0"><span class="c1">EDUCATION</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c4">3. Publicly funded charter schools do not have the same transparency requirements as traditional DCPS schools including disclosing salaries, records, or vendor contracts less than $100,000 nor are charter schools required to have open meetings. Charter advocates argue that they lack the budget to comply with FOIA requests while open government advocates and parents want more access to information. Do you believe charters should be subject to FOIA? How would you resolve these opposing stances on charter school transparency? </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">Yes, the DC government is responsible for public education and cannot properly allocate taxpayer funding without fully knowing the use to which the funding is put. &nbsp;I will hold meetings where Ward 4 charter school parents and students who have suffered abrupt charter closings to find out how the lack of transparency has impacted their students&rsquo; education. &nbsp;Equally important, transparency is needed to eliminate the false proposition that traditional public schools are in &ldquo;competition&rdquo; with public charter schools. &nbsp;The &ldquo;competition&rdquo; model, fueled by the per pupil formula, penalizes schools who lose students due to poor conditions by reducing funding to those schools, thereby preventing needed upgrades to physical plants, adding teachers and courses, and other services. &nbsp;I will advocate greater funding to traditional public schools because they face greater challenges, as they must accept every student at any time during the school year regardless of readiness, and they educate twice the percentage of ELL students than charter schools and greater percentages of at-risk and disabled students.</span></p><h2 class="c3" id="h.tyjcwt"><span class="c1">HOUSING</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c12">4.

If not, explain where you differ. What other ideas would you propose to help residents who are negatively impacted by rising rents?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">I am a member of the Reclaim Rent Control coalition and fully support the platform. &nbsp;I would prohibit DC from giving public funding to projects like the tax increment financing deal to Brookland Manor which resulted in a plan to drastically reduce the number and sizes (3-4 bedrooms) of rental units affordable to low and moderate-income families, particularly the current tenants who have large families. &nbsp;Developers should get public funding only when the projects relieve the housing shortage for extremely low income and very low income households ($36, 400 and $60,650 for family of 4) or low income households where the greatest housing shortage exists. &nbsp;I will fight to double the percentage of affordable housing under inclusionary zoning from 8%- 10% to 16% -20% that developers must provide to qualify for District subsidies and expand inclusionary zoning to now exempt downtown DC. &nbsp;I will fight for DC government to implement land value recapture every time DC upzones and makes land more valuable by requiring the beneficiary to place a portion of the increased value into affordable housing.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c12">5. Our public housing tenants are facing a serious crisis, and we have little confidence in the DC Housing Authority&rsquo;s plan to &ldquo;reposition&rdquo; public housing. DC4D has endorsed a </span><span class="c10"><a class="c5" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/demand-dc-housing-authority-to-preserve-public-housing-and-residents-rights&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573323404267000">petition </a></span><span class="c4">to DCHA with recommendations on protecting tenants. Have you signed the petition; if not, why not? What other policies would you propose to protect and/or expand public housing and housing for very low-income residents in DC?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c7">I am a long time, active member of Empower DC which developed the petition; I&rsquo;ve signed and fully support the petition&rsquo;s demands. &nbsp;DC government has willfully failed over more than 25 years to fix up and preserve public housing. &nbsp;It demolished public housing under Hope VI and New Communities Initiative and refused to replace the demolished units with the same number and sizes of units affordable to households with public housing level incomes. &nbsp;DC must fix up and maintain deteriorating public housing, and replace hundreds of public housing units that DCHA demolished since the 1990&rsquo;s but failed to replace, instead building higher income and market rate housing. &nbsp;I propose: That DC government contract with public housing tenants to renovate public housing and provide for one-for-one replacement of public housing units of the same number and bedroom sizes as those demolished while providing tenants an enforceable right to return to housing of the same size. &nbsp;I will also fight for a provision that public housing must be renovated/rebuilt before market rate housing added to the project or at least at the same pace as market rate housing. &nbsp;I also propose that public housing tenants have the right of private attorney generals to sue when DC government fails to maintain public housing like the failures at the new Arthur Capper Senior building. &nbsp;I will fight for dedicated funding for public housing repairs by fighting for legislation to reduce the estate tax exemption to $2 million from the current more than $5.5 million.</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.3dy6vkm"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8">GOVERNMENT/ETHICS</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">6. Are you participating in Fair Elections? If not, why not? What other ideas would you propose to limit the influence of money in politics? &nbsp;I am participating in the Fair Elections Program.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">I would ban outside employment for Councilmembers. &nbsp;I will also fight to require Councilmembers to report to OCF and make public on their official Council pages and websites, and government paid mailings to constituents all political contributions received from any business (including business advocacy organization) directly or indirectly within 2 years before or after any vote on legislation that directly or indirectly affects the business. &nbsp;I would also require Councilmembers to report investment or management involvement in any business on which they are voting within 2 years before or after any vote. &nbsp;These policies would have required several Councilmembers who received contributions from the local and national restaurant industry associations prior to voting against Initiative 77 to reveal those contributions.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">7. Do you support abolishing Constituent Service Funds and replacing them with appropriated funds to serve resident needs? If not, explain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">Yes, I support abolition of constituent services funds because of the longstanding corruption associated with the funds and longstanding failure on the part of Councilmembers to use the funds to help needy constituents.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">8. Will you commit to vote for Vote16DC?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">Yes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">9. Since DC frequently has races with many candidates in which the winner gets far less than a majority of the votes, would you support implementing ranked choice voting or some other method to ensure some level of majority support?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">Yes, I would support ranked choice voting. &nbsp;With rank choice voting, the voter has impact beyond the voter&rsquo;s first choice. &nbsp;I have participated in rank choice voting as a former WPFW FM Local Station Board member and current listener member.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">10. What role the does DC Council play during the Ballot initiative process? &nbsp;Note: question is unclear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">I believe and will push for legislation that would prevent DC Council from overturning a ballot initiative for a minimum 2-year period unless the initiative is discriminatory, violates another statute, violates a person&rsquo;s protected rights, is unconstitutional, or the conditions under which the initiative was voted have substantially changed.</span></p><h2 class="c3" id="h.1t3h5sf"><span class="c1">CRIMINAL JUSTICE</span></h2><p class="c0" id="h.4d34og8"><span class="c4">11. Do you support decriminalizing sex work? If not, explain how you would reduce the violence and exploitation currently suffered by these workers?</span></p><p class="c0" id="h.re48rlki4oe7"><span class="c7">I support decriminalizing the sale of sex by the sex worker. &nbsp;There is a model implemented in certain Europe which decriminalizes the sex worker, but not the persons who procure the sex. &nbsp;I support this middle ground because I am concerned about the continued exploitation of women. &nbsp;I believe this position will better protect the actions of sex workers and require the police to focus on pimps, traffickers, and others who would exploit the sex workers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">12. Do you support ending stop and frisk in DC?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">Yes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">13. What public health policy ideas would you propose to reduce violence in DC?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">I will advocate for a nurse, guidance counselor, and a social worker with mental health training in every public school. &nbsp;I will propose legislation to require testing students for learning disabilities. &nbsp;I will advocate for greater funding of the NEAR Act&rsquo;s violence interruption program that seeks out those most at risk of committing and becoming victims of violence to learn their backgrounds, the conditions in which they live, and provide the educational, real job training which leads to living wage jobs, and services, including housing and mental health services, needed to change their life trajectories. &nbsp; In short, I would shift the focus from criminalizing noncriminal behavior in school and out of school (e.g., hanging around Kennedy Street, NW) and develop programs that enhance the attractiveness of in school education, training and advance opportunities outside school, and enhance community based services.</span></p><h2 class="c3" id="h.2s8eyo1"><span class="c1">IMMIGRATION</span></h2><p class="c6"><span class="c4">14. Do you support legislation to prohibit the District from cooperating with federal immigration agencies, including by complying with detainer requests, absent a judicial warrant or order?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c14"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c7">Yes; it is a constitutional violation to hold a person beyond his sentence or without a sentence for another entity.</span></p><h2 class="c3" id="h.17dp8vu"><span class="c1">ENVIRONMENT</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c4">15. Given Pepco&rsquo;s resistance to transitioning to clean renewable energy, do you think DC would benefit from municipally owned electricity? If not, why?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">Yes, I believe DC will benefit from a municipally owned utility. &nbsp;First, I learned when I opposed the merger that Exelon wanted the merger with Pepco to help finance its flagging nuclear plants. &nbsp;Also, a municipally owned utility would be a nonprofit entity which could use tax exempt financing, will not pay federal income tax, and use money saved from taxes and profit not paid to shareholders to provide maintenance and prevention, upgrading, and eventually undergrounding of wiring.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">16. What specific legislative initiatives will you introduce in Council Period 24 to protect DC from the effects of climate change?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">I would introduce legislation to study and retrofit and reinforce bridges, streets, and pavements to withstand increased temperatures and the increased fluctuation in temperatures as climate temperatures rise. &nbsp;I would also introduce legislation to repair and redesign schools, libraries, recreation and senior centers, public housing, and other public buildings so that they can withstand the increased temperatures and the extreme fluctuation in temperatures as climate temperatures rise. &nbsp;In preparing schools to withstand the weather extremes, I would propose legislation that required climate science classes in the public schools so that students can learn the new science and participate in projects to protect and upgrade their schools and libraries, and be introduced to climate science careers. &nbsp;The schools can be used as cooling centers as extreme weather increases. &nbsp;As for transportation, I believe the time has come for dedicated bus lanes on the most congested streets and better coordinated cross-town bussing so that public transportation can become more convenient than using owner or ride-hailing vehicles. &nbsp;There is also an important climate justice issue which requires DC to redress placement of communities of color at risk as a result of having built highways near their communities (old Arthur Capper/Carrollsburg, Ivy City), subjecting their communities to toxic waste like trash transfer stations, and storing equipment and busses in their community like DC has done and tried to do in Ivy City.</span></p><h2 class="c3" id="h.3rdcrjn"><span class="c1">HEALTH</span></h2><p class="c6"><span class="c4">17.

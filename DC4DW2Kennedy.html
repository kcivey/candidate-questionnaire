Do you think this is a fair tax structure? If so, explain why. If not, explain why and how you would improve it.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c4">According to that study, D.C. has the most equitable tax system in the country except for California &mdash; largely on the basis that our income tax structure is more progressive than the vast majority of states, which either have fewer or no brackets at all (flat tax), and the fact that our residential property tax rate is considerably lower than the commercial property tax rates. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c4">Nonetheless, the chart points to a practical limit to the progressivity of our tax structure, or that of practically every other jurisdiction: property and sales taxes (our other two major sources of revenue) are not &mdash; in basic conceptual form &mdash; designed to be proportionate to a person&rsquo;s ability to pay. </span></p><p class="c8 c21"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c4">With that in mind, I&rsquo;ve called for raising the income cap for the Schedule H credit above the current $55,000 level and increasing the maximum credit available so that cost-burdened renters and homeowners can obtain relief. Along these lines, I am open to some form of sales tax rebate for low-income residents as is done in other states. D.C. is lucky to have a revenue base not overly reliant on one particular stream of revenue, and a fairly progressive tax policy overall, but more can be done to make it fairer still.</span></p><h2 class="c12" id="h.30j0zll"><span class="c7">WORKERS&rsquo; RIGHTS</span></h2><p class="c8"><span class="c3">2. DC has a proud history of passing landmark labor laws but a lackluster record of enforcing these laws or proactively informing workers about existing or new rights. What will you do as a CM to change this status quo and ensure there is strong oversight &amp; enforcement of worker rights?</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c4">We certainly need to do a better job enforcing our current laws. In particular, we shouldn&rsquo;t be completely reliant on an adversarial, complaint-based process whereby workers must self-report incidences of wage theft and/or other violations. Instead, we should consider adopting a strategic enforcement approach, whereby efforts are undertaken proactively to monitor industries where data indicates that wage theft is likely to occur. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c4">Workers who wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily be comfortable with or have the confidence and knowledge to initiate complaints might nonetheless be responsive and cooperative if they are contacted in the course of a more general workplace survey undertaken by DOES.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c4">Additionally, I believe the Council should demand a more detailed outreach and engagement plan on DOES&rsquo; part for notifying and educating the public when laws change and give workers new or different rights and benefits. Outreach must occur in multiple languages and be developed in concert with trusted, community-based organizations and advocates to maximize effectiveness and ensure that the workers most vulnerable to workplace abuse understand and feel comfortable raising issues or concerns.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c4">These types of approaches will not happen overnight and will take a change in agency culture to achieve but the Council can play a positive role in influencing that transition in the course of its oversight and budgeting duties. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c4">Effective oversight takes a mixture of knowledge, hard work, focus, and a willingness to be alternately aggressive or diplomatic depending on the circumstances and the situation. Oversight should be a continuous, year-round fact-finding process instead of a chore to be completed one month a year.</span></p><h2 class="c12" id="h.1fob9te"><span class="c7">EDUCATION</span></h2><p class="c6"><span class="c3">3. Publicly funded charter schools do not have the same transparency requirements as traditional DCPS schools including disclosing salaries, records, or vendor contracts less than $100,000 nor are charter schools required to have open meetings. Charter advocates argue that they lack the budget to comply with FOIA requests while open government advocates and parents want more access to information. Do you believe charters should be subject to FOIA? How would you resolve these opposing stances on charter school transparency?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">As an Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner, I am subject to the Freedom of Information Act despite being an unpaid volunteer with only advisory authority and an annual budget of just $20,000 at my Commission&rsquo;s disposal. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">Nonetheless, I believe that it is quite right that we operate under FOIA because we are a government-chartered body that performs a public function and receives taxpayer support. For that reason, I also believe that public charter schools should be covered by FOIA. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">I understand and am sympathetic to the concerns that the charter community has raised about potential administrative hassles and resource burdens. I understand more than most what FOIA can entail personally, and the frustration that comes with having to take time from your core duties to deal with requests.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">That, however, is the obligation and burden that all public officials &mdash; including those in our public education system &mdash; must respect if we are to practice our stated commitment to the principles of open government and transparency. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">With that non-negotiable expectation in mind, I think the constructive approach to address the charter community&rsquo;s concerns is to ensure that this requirement is not an unfunded mandate. Charter schools should have the means by which to receive monies for the additional resources or administrative support required to meet FOIA compliance if at all possible. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c7">HOUSING</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c11 c14">4.

If not, explain where you differ. What other ideas would you propose to help residents who are negatively impacted by rising rents?</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c4">I support the reauthorization of rent control and many of the goals of that petition. My position is that we need to expand rent control regulations on a rolling basis to buildings built after 1975, establishing a more robust rent stabilization regime to reverse the long-term decline in the number of units subject to protection. </span></p><p class="c10 c21"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c4">Having lost almost 50,000 rent-stabilized units since 1985 (almost 40% of the then-130,000 total), we clearly need a change in direction. We also need to ensure a degree of predictability and stability in the housing market to make certain we&rsquo;re not disincentivizing new housing production or encouraging developers to convert apartment projects into condominiums.</span></p><p class="c10 c21"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c4">The situation that we confront right now, however, is that as more residential units are built a smaller share of the District&rsquo;s overall rental housing stock is subject to rent control regulation. That&rsquo;s problematic for long-term tenants who are experiencing unstable housing costs and that&rsquo;s a major contributing factor to displacement.</span></p><p class="c10 c21"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c4">The problem is compounded by the prospect that we will likely have larger numbers of long-term renters in the District moving forward as a result of how difficult it has become for lower- and middle-class residents to afford to buy here. Soaring property values and large debt burdens make ownership extremely challenging for many younger people, myself included.</span></p><p class="c10 c21"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c4">Historically, long-term tenants under rent control have benefitted from the accrued savings that add up over the years relative to what they would have paid under market rate. That savings enables tenants to stay in their units. We need to make sure that that same opportunity exists for newer renters.</span></p><p class="c10 c21"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c4">I do agree that, through more vigorous enforcement, we should crack down on the practice of management companies using &ldquo;capital improvements&rdquo; of dubious necessity or cost-effectiveness to justify large rent increases. With respect to hardship petitions, building owners need some profit incentive to maintain and reinvest in their buildings, but that shouldn&rsquo;t be treated as a means for property owners to go upmarket and displace existing low-income tenants, so I&rsquo;m open to changes in an attempt to better strike that balance.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c11 c14">5. Our public housing tenants are facing a serious crisis, and we have little confidence in the DC Housing Authority&rsquo;s plan to &ldquo;reposition&rdquo; public housing. DC4D has endorsed a</span><span class="c11 c14"><a class="c0" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/demand-dc-housing-authority-to-preserve-public-housing-and-residents-rights&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573312313446000">&nbsp;</a></span><span class="c2 c11"><a class="c0" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/demand-dc-housing-authority-to-preserve-public-housing-and-residents-rights&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573312313446000">petition</a></span><span class="c2 c11">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">to DCHA with recommendations on protecting tenants. Have you signed the petition; if not, why not? What other policies would you propose to protect and/or expand public housing and housing for very low-income residents in DC?</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c4">I have signed the petition and firmly believe that DCHA has an obligation to protect and provide for its existing tenants, and ultimately expand the number of public housing units in the District. DCHA absolutely must prevent displacement and require every public housing redevelopment to build first so residents have a real option to stay in their community rather than just a promised right of return that may not happen within a reasonable timeframe. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c4">In a city where rents are rising rapidly, public housing is one of our most important tools to ensure that District residents aren&rsquo;t displaced. In practice, this means not just a 1:1 replacement of public housing units and bedrooms but reinvesting any profits generated in public/private redevelopment to create more public housing units. We need to do better than just stop the bleeding, we need to actively create more opportunity for extremely low income households at 30% and 50% Market Family Income and below.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c4">We also need to ensure that the health and safety of residents are protected and decisions about the future of communities are taken in true consultation with existing residents. To make this happen, the D.C. Council needs to take a more active hand in overseeing DCHA as it embarks on a watershed transition of its assets. For this and other reasons, I would seek to serve on the Housing Committee &mdash; which has oversight of DCHA.</span></p><h2 class="c12" id="h.3znysh7"><span class="c7">GOVERNMENT/ETHICS</span></h2><p class="c6"><span class="c11 c14">6. Are you participating in Fair Elections? If not, why not? What other ideas would you propose to limit the influence of money in politics?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c14">I am proud to be the very first candidate to file under Fair Elections, and I supported the concept before it was law with a </span><span class="c2"><a class="c0" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bd464bcc-f588-48fb-8882-8d70c4a297c7.filesusr.com/ugd/554760_d3ca60e243d6464ea820bd334d4b1f16.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573312313447000">resolution</a></span><span class="c4">&nbsp;from our ANC. If successful campaigns are run under this program, it will send a powerful message that the electorate cares about campaigns free from corporate, PAC, and large-donor influence and hopefully encourage a diverse pool of candidates to enter subsequent races. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">In addition to Fair Elections, I&rsquo;m happy that the Council passed legislation banning the bundling of campaign contributions and outlawing contributions from District contractors starting next cycle. Our goal should be to identify and thwart potential opportunities for influence peddling, so I would encourage the Council to look at banning corporate contributions altogether.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">That said, laws and regulations are only as good as the systems in place for enforcing them. Given the many changes that have recently gone into effect or will be soon, I think it is important that we review and evaluate if we are providing the resources and direction necessary to ensure that a restructured Office of Campaign Finance is able to effectively carry out its more intensive mandate. This includes having Council scrutinize closely both appointees to the board of the new, independent campaign finance body and the entity&rsquo;s overall performance. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">To that end, I think Councilmember Allen has been extremely helpful in shepherding the important legislation that has passed to-date. I hope to contribute to an after-action evaluation of the Fair Elections Program with the other candidates to identify potential opportunities to enhance the current law and empower small-donor campaigns to the largest extent possible. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">7. Do you support abolishing Constituent Service Funds and replacing them with appropriated funds to serve resident needs? If not, explain.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">I support abolishing Constituent Service Funds because they are loosely-regulated means for people and entities (mostly special interests) to influence politicians, often with little overall public benefit. We need to avoid potential conflicts between money and politics, and there are better ways to serve the immediate needs of constituents than via the maintenance of slush funds. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">Government service delivery has improved, which has decreased the need for constituent service funds, and so I think our efforts must be focused on further improving service delivery and educating constituents on the programs and opportunities if and when they experience an issue or hardship.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">8. Will you commit to vote for Vote16DC?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">Absolutely. I am very passionate about getting younger people more active in politics. I served as a youth governor in the YMCA Youth In Government program when I was in high school and later served as a volunteer with high schoolers in DCPS, experiences which I think provide me with helpful insights on this issue. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">I am consistently impressed and inspired by the perspective that students bring to issues; our discourse would benefit if they were empowered and encouraged to contribute more often. It&rsquo;s not enough to pat them on the head and say &ldquo;job well done&rdquo; when they come to testify at a Council hearing, or march for gun safety, or passionately speak out against inaction on climate change. Young people can perceive when their input is truly respected and when they are not. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">It is true that 16- and 17-year-olds may lack life experience, particularly in the working world. It&rsquo;s also true that their views may change. I don&rsquo;t, however, think that that makes them any less valid...it just makes them different. Perhaps as a general rule the perspective of high schoolers is less wise than that of those who are decades older, but it also tends to be less cynical...and younger people have to deal with the consequences of decisions being taken today much longer than anyone else.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">Our electorate is at its best when it is most reasonably representative of the perspectives and life experiences of the population at large. 16- and 17-year-olds work, pay taxes, drive, and can be held criminally liable as though they are adults &mdash; it therefore seems reasonable enough to make them eligible to vote. By doing so, we may be able to form the habits of active citizenry at an early age and counteract the pervasive low turnout in our elections. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">9. Since DC frequently has races with many candidates in which the winner gets far less than a majority of the votes, would you support implementing ranked choice voting or some other method to ensure some level of majority support?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">Ranked choice voting is an excellent way to ensure the majority of voters have their wishes realized. I support it wholeheartedly.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">Along with RCV, I support eliminating local primary elections altogether and just electing all candidates on one ballot at the higher-turnout November election. This would save money, bring about election outcomes with broader participation, shorten the length of the election cycle, and eliminate instances of six-plus month lame-duck periods for officeholders defeated in the current primaries.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">10. What role the does DC Council play during the Ballot initiative process?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">It&rsquo;s not easy to get an initiative on the ballot here. Therefore, I believe that the Council has an obligation to uphold the will of the voters unless there is a material change in fact or circumstance from the time the electorate voted that could reasonably have been expected to change the outcome.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">At the very least, the Council should have grappled more seriously with the message sent by the electorate last year regarding Initiative 77. I believe that repealing a voter-approved initiative three months after it passed (waiting only that long because there was an intervening two-month recess) sends a very poor signal (intended or not) about the degree to which the Council respects the voters, especially when the initiative passed in seven of the eight wards.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">I respect the different views and considerations that went into the debate last year; I took a long time to make up my mind on the issue before I voted &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; but once it passed, the Council should have limited its modifications to questions of &ldquo;how&rdquo; it was going to be implemented, not &ldquo;whether.&rdquo; By not doing so, I believe they&rsquo;ve set the District up for a continuing, divisive debate when we needed to settle the issue and move on. That&rsquo;s what initiatives are for. </span></p><h2 class="c12" id="h.2et92p0"><span class="c7">CRIMINAL JUSTICE</span></h2><p class="c6"><span class="c3">11. Do you support decriminalizing sex work? If not, explain how you would reduce the violence and exploitation currently suffered by these workers?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">Rampant employment discrimination, rising housing costs, and our broken immigration system have led many people, particularly trans women of color, into sex work as a way to meet their needs. The status quo is clearly not working, and we are failing D.C. residents. We need to do better, and first and foremost, that starts with providing increased resources to those most in need so that no one is driven to survival sex. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c14">In June, I led ANC 2A in passing a </span><span class="c2"><a class="c0" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bd464bcc-f588-48fb-8882-8d70c4a297c7.filesusr.com/ugd/554760_03f374d2537b40afb58f0f8b35740460.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573312313449000">resolution</a></span><span class="c4">&nbsp;calling on the mayor to increase funding for LGBTQ service providers, so we can better meet the needs of trans people and youth experiencing homelessness. As councilmember, I will work closely with organizations such as Casa Ruby, Wanda Alston, and SMYAL to gain funding for programs and services for the LGBTQ community, especially those most under-served and at-risk. I will also ensure that we get serious about ending employment discrimination and support effective employment programs for the trans community. And I will take action to build more affordable housing and lower public transportation costs so that basic needs are met.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">I don&rsquo;t think locking up sex workers does them or anyone else any good. It&rsquo;s not a productive use of police resources, it often victimizes a very vulnerable population, it clearly doesn&rsquo;t work since the activity persists, and it hasn&rsquo;t curbed the residential quality-of-life complaints associated with the activity.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c14">So I am open to a conversation about how to move forward under a better model, knowing that there is one, but I am skeptical of not regulating the activity at all. Applying models named for &mdash; and employed in &mdash; entire countries like Norway or New Zealand on a city/state like Washington, D.C. may not produce the same, desired-for effects. We need to be careful not to cause a dramatic increase in demand and exploitation, and it&rsquo;s critical that the Ward 2 councilmember in particular work collaboratively with advocacy groups on all sides of the debate </span><span class="c11 c14">and</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;with community members in neighborhoods like Logan Circle where residents have strong feelings about the issue from their experience co-existing with sex workers on the street.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c14">I am committed to working constructively on the issue and helping develop a workable solution. In the meantime, I pledge to provide strong oversight of MPD and work on enhancing opportunities for sex workers to report abuse or coercion through a third-party entity so that workers feel comfortable with those who should be assisting them.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">12. Do you support ending stop and frisk in DC?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">I support ending stop and frisk in D.C. The research is clear: this practice is dehumanizing, disproportionately impacts people of color, and does not decrease crime.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">Stop and frisk also contributes to a culture of distrust of the police in many communities. When the District passed the NEAR Act, we dedicated ourselves to a collaborative, community-based policing approach. Stop and frisk runs counter to that, and we have to move beyond it to make progress on police/community relations.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">13. What public health policy ideas would you propose to reduce violence in DC?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">We need to take a multi-pronged, community-based public health approach to violence prevention in the District. Reducing violence should not be under the sole or exclusive purview of law enforcement and the criminal justice system. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">As such, we need to start in our schools by helping our children be able to see schools as safe spaces and investing on social-emotional growth and healthy relationship development. We need to make sure that our schools have full-time mental and health workers that can address the needs of students early and provide targeted strategies and mental health supports to prevent violence. Furthermore, the Office of the Deputy Mayor for Health and Human Services as well as the Department of Health, Behavioral Health, Human Services, and Youth Rehabilitation Services need more funding towards proactively providing outreach services in the community rather than waiting for victims or survivors to request services or with referrals from the criminal justice system. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">We also need to ensure that models like OAG&rsquo;s Cure the Streets Program and the NEAR Act&rsquo;s violence interrupters are properly funded and expanded in a transparent manner, with resources deployed in the neighborhoods that need them most. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c14">Finally, we need to ensure that there is proper oversight over all violence prevention programs and that there is proper data collection, transparency, and accountability. I would support a Council-led performance accountability plan that goes beyond the scope of the NEAR Act to ensure that all of our violence prevention programs are operating efficiently and effectively.</span></p><h2 class="c12" id="h.tyjcwt"><span class="c7">IMMIGRATION</span></h2><p class="c8"><span class="c3">14. Do you support legislation to prohibit the District from cooperating with federal immigration agencies, including by complying with detainer requests, absent a judicial warrant or order?</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c4">Yes. If the phrase &ldquo;Sanctuary City&rdquo; is to be more than a slogan without substance, then we need to ensure from a substantive standpoint that we do what we can to protect our most vulnerable communities from the actions of a federal government pursuing policies which run counter to our values as a city.. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c4">To that end, I support the Council&rsquo;s recent action to ensure as a legal matter that the D.C. government ceases all voluntary cooperation with ICE. I think it&rsquo;s also important that we continue and expand on our legal aid efforts to assist undocumented residents with representation in immigration law cases. We need to ensure that MPD and all of our government service providers are properly trained on how to engage with immigrant communities, understanding the fear of government that understandably exists there now. We also need to work especially hard at outreach efforts with trusted community partners to ensure that the present climate of fear and intimidation doesn&rsquo;t discourage undocumented residents from being comfortable accessing services or seeking help.</span></p><h2 class="c12" id="h.3dy6vkm"><span class="c7">ENVIRONMENT</span></h2><p class="c6"><span class="c3">15. Given Pepco&rsquo;s resistance to transitioning to clean renewable energy, do you think DC would benefit from municipally owned electricity? If not, why?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">My three main priorities with our electric utility are to get towards 100% renewable as quickly as possible, have a stable and consistent level of service, and to maintain predictable and reasonable rates for our residents.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c14">I formally advocated against the merger between Exelon and Pepco in 2015 when I was Chair of ANC 2A [</span><span class="c2"><a class="c0" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/554760_4d6c3cdfc58f4973a9d05dde44897fac.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573312313450000">1</a></span><span class="c14">, </span><span class="c2"><a class="c0" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/554760_de1c106ab2074450b58b6d7e947b50c6.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573312313450000">2</a></span><span class="c4">], saying that in part, we could face &ldquo;long-term loss of local influence, community involvement, and direct accountability.&rdquo; Now that the merger is completed, I&rsquo;m focused on how best to move forward with the above three main priorities.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c14">As Pepco is a distribution utility and does not generate its own electricity, the fuel mix of what turns our lights on comes from other companies, purchased through a regional transmission organization. I </span><span class="c2"><a class="c0" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bd464bcc-f588-48fb-8882-8d70c4a297c7.filesusr.com/ugd/554760_59e3ea2428ad4306ac8363e652010e48.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573312313451000">supported</a></span><span class="c4">&nbsp;the Clean Energy D.C. Omnibus Amendment Act of 2018, one of the most aggressive climate bills in the country, which mandates that 100% of all electricity in the District is derived from renewable sources by 2032, doubles the amount of solar energy deployed in the District, and provides energy bill assistance to support low- and moderate-income neighbors.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">Municipalization is one tool to have greater control of the fuel mix, and I am glad in recent years the District has invested in studying this possibility. However, the costs involved with purchasing an over-six-billion-dollar portion of a publicly-traded company would be a massive undertaking by the District and a financial burden that could take the form of a tax on residents similar to what Boulder, Colorado voters chose to do, or sizable increases in electricity rates, factoring in the costs that would be required to successfully complete such a transaction. I would consider municipalization but it is not a near-term nor inexpensive solution. There are other ways to achieve the goal of 100% renewable energy in D.C.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">I will advocate strongly that our Public Service Commission enforce a more renewable fuel mix and make the prioritization of such a key determining factor in my votes on nominees to the PSC. I will prioritize creating additional incentives and removing roadblocks on residential and commercial solar projects to increase the amount of locally generated renewable power. I support legislating long-term renewable energy contracts (which was removed from the Clean Energy D.C. Omnibus Amendment Act of 2018) and exploring a Community Choice Aggregation model to bring our fuel mix to 100% renewable faster.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">16. What specific legislative initiatives will you introduce in Council Period 24 to protect DC from the effects of climate change?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">At this stage, we need to be focused not only on climate change prevention, but also resiliency efforts. That may take additional legislation along the lines of the clean energy initiatives previously discussed, but I think more than legislation and planning, it takes follow-through. That&rsquo;s really where we&rsquo;re falling short on these issues. The Council&rsquo;s ability to impact that largely comes down to its effectiveness at using the oversight process to encourage agency implementation and leveraging the budget to direct resources &mdash; for example, toward the end of fulfilling the moveDC plan that (if followed faithfully) would have a tremendous positive effect on reducing transportation emissions. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">Given our lack of heavy manufacturing (a sizable contributor to emissions in most places) and the lack of control that we have on emissions from Virginia and Maryland, I believe the transportation sector, renewable energy policy, and better building insulation incentivization are what we have the most direct, positive control over in terms of reducing our footprint. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">That said, we can look at legislation likely to have marginal impact, understanding that every small, positive change matters. In that vein, I would like to see the Council amend the historic preservation statutes to clarify a more permissive standard of evaluation for solar panels and other renewable energy infrastructure, particularly since the infrastructure doesn&rsquo;t constitute an irreversible change to historic structures.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">On resiliency, I would like to see the Council direct funding resources to a comprehensive study of resiliency efforts that will need to be undertaken in a range of different warming scenarios. We need to be thinking about climate change front-of-mind as a long-term problem and an inevitability that will take long-term, costly infrastructure investment even under a best-case scenario.</span></p><h2 class="c12" id="h.1t3h5sf"><span class="c7">HEALTH</span></h2><p class="c8"><span class="c3">17. The DC Council passed the landmark &ldquo;Birth to Three&rdquo; legislation providing universal child care at subsidized rates; however, they failed to fully fund it. What solutions would you propose to create sustainable funding for the program?</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c1">From research, we know that 90% of brain development occurs in the first three years of life. Based on this statistic alone, we know that failing to fund Birth-to-Three will likely help perpetuate the achievement gap and set many of our children up for failure. &nbsp;I therefore support the Birth-to-Three For All D.C. Act, and am committed to fully funding it. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c1">I will work vigilantly to review the current budget, identify reprogramming opportunities, and stop tax abatements or tax credits that don&rsquo;t provide a return on investment. By carefully scrutinizing the budget and making focused, strategic decisions I believe the District can become a leader in supporting families and childcare professionals whom we entrust with the care of our children. </span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c1">A $200 million additional ask is quite sizable in the context of the locally-raised budget, particularly if the economy fails to maintain the momentum it has sustained for the past several years, so it is likely that we will need to continue to phase-in this budgetary commitment &ndash; something that the Council started on in the last budget process.</span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c20 c14">That said, then-Council Chair Vince Gray was able to identify the resources necessary to fund Universal Pre-K even when the District was experiencing a recession &ndash; so I believe that the ability to fund this comes down to political will and prioritization. As far as that is concerned, I don&rsquo;t know that there is any additional investment the District can make &ndash; in any budget category &ndash; that would be more impactful than this initiative.</span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c19" id="h.4d34og8"><span class="c14 c20">On a personal note, I was pleased to help lead the fight to maintain the former Stevens School building on 21st Street as a public asset for &nbsp;youth and families. Eventually, that use </span><span class="c2 c23"><a class="c0" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://mayor.dc.gov/release/mayor-bowser-announces-plan-reopen-thaddeus-stevens-school-new-child-development-center-and&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573312313453000">became</a></span><span class="c1">&nbsp;an infant and toddler program, which will be one of the first/few in the District when it opens next year. I believe that building out more programs like this is critical to addressing the Birth-to-Three gap. </span></p><p class="c21 c29"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c29"><span class="c7">BACKGROUND</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c11 c14">18. </span><span class="c11 c13">(Ward 2 challengers only)</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Are you committed to removing the incumbent from office? If yes, what criteria should be used to determine who is the best candidate to challenge him?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">I have consistently called on the incumbent to resign, and I believe that voters should choose the next Ward 2 councilmember. But I am willing to step aside if Councilmember Evans runs again and another candidate is more viable, because the priority needs to be his removal from office.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">This is a ward Council race, though, and it will be decided by Ward 2 voters. That involves a different set of considerations than an at-large Council race would; ward Council races are much more personal and rooted in relationships, experience, and community networks. All of the ward councilmembers presently sitting on the Council and those who came before them had a strong base of community support in their ward.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">In that respect, I believe that I&rsquo;m the strongest candidate at this stage since I have by far the most endorsements of any candidate from community leaders in the ward, the most money from within the ward of any candidate, and the most contributors from the ward of any candidate.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">Endorsements that are likely to be salient to the ward electorate are important, and a strong candidate would also be one with a strong base of volunteers that can work to turn out voters. Polling can be a useful measure of strength, but based on the small electorate and the variability inherent in pulling from small sample sizes, one would probably want more than one independent poll showing a statistically significant difference to derive any conclusions.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">All of these factors, taken together, should form the basis for a decision made collectively by the candidates in the best interests of Ward 2 if the decision becomes necessary.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c11 c14">19. </span><span class="c13 c11">(Challengers only) </span><span class="c3">As a first-year legislator, you won&rsquo;t be allowed to chair a committee but will be able to express preferences for which committees you will sit on. Which committee is your top preference and why?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">The Committee on Transportation and the Environment because transportation is central to opportunity, and to the ability to access jobs, training, and education. We cannot create this opportunity without implementing Vision Zero with more urgency and more teeth. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4">I am proud to have supported many Vision Zero efforts already and have supported every Vision Zero initiative before our ANC. I want to continue to be a vocal transportation advocate on the Council, using the bully pulpit and the budget process to advance stalled priorities like the 9th Street Protected Bike Lane. I understand that transportation issues can be contentious but having committee members with relationships with community leaders can help us advance localized infrastructure decisions that have District-wide impact.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">20. Briefly explain what systems you have or would put in place to get feedback from your constituents on policy?</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c4">I am proud to have the support of nearly half the Advisory Neighborhood Commissioners in the ward and many other community association board members, condo board presidents, HSA leaders, and other civically active residents. Having a strong working relationship with community leaders based on trust built up over the years is critically important for a ward councilmember, because commissioners and civic leaders have a good pulse on what is happening on a grassroots, block-by-block level. This is crucial for identifying issues as they arise and responding accordingly. </span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c4">Moreover, the support I have received from community leaders is indicative of my seven-year track record of listening to every constituent, including those with whom I disagree, and working together to forge consensus on tough issues. </span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c4">On a more substantive level, I believe that being accessible is the most important thing an elected official can be, and that starts with how I am running my campaign. I am currently holding &ldquo;Coffee with Patrick&rdquo; office hour events, sending a weekly newsletter about what we&rsquo;ve been up to to keep voters apprised and able to provide feedback, maintaining an active social media presence, and have had my cell phone number posted on our campaign site and Facebook page for the entire duration of the campaign. I am planning to continue with all of this while in office, so that my constituents can reach my team and me at any hour of the day with their thoughts and concerns.</span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c4">I also believe that we need to bring Council hearings out of the Wilson Building and into the community more often, so that more people will be able to provide feedback and testify. For this reason I support more field hearings, and more hearings held on evenings and weekends.</span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c4">I love serving my community, I found my calling in doing so, and the personalized, hyperlocal nature of ward-level representation is what attracts me to this role.</span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c15"></span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c15"></span></p></body></html>

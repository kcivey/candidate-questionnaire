Have you run for office previously? If so, please provide detail.	Yes; I have run for Ward 4 Council; Advisory Neighborhood Commission, and DC Democratic State Committee Ward 4 Committeewoman	Yes. I ran for At-Large Committeewoman on the DC Democratic State Committee and am currently serving on the committee.	Did not complete questionnaire
Tell us about who you are and why you are running.	I am an African American female activist/trade unionist who has worked for decades to eliminate systemic disparities against working class people of all races, ethnicities, genders, and abilities.  I have fought against employment and housing discrimination, for labor and immigrant rights as a steward and Union lawyer, and for affordable housing for all.  I want to fight legislatively on DC Council, using a racial and economic justice lens, to strengthen and advance the lives of DC's working class and all marginalized people in our community.  	From my days as a student at Rudolph to my time in the DC Attorney General's Office, I've had unshakeable belief that integrity, equity, and justice should be the rule, not the exception. Those values were instilled in me by my mom and grandmother. They taught me the importance of education, hard work, and the responsibility of lifting as we climb.  Whether fighting for quality public schools in every neighborhood or implementing a public health approach to crime, I understand that problems in education, housing, climate, health, and safety are all deeply connected. To solve one of them, we need to address all of them. To build the Ward 4 we believe in, one that works for all of us, we need bold progressive leadership, unbought, unbossed and willing to fight for accountability, affordability, and fairness for everyone in our community! That is why I am running.  I do not have evidence that our current council member shares the same understanding of our community, nor does he govern with an integrated, values based approach to systemic change. I know that my community is ready for an accountable, new type of leader and I am that woman.	Did not complete questionnaire
Tell us why you want DC Working Families' endorsement.	DC Working Families Party and I share and have worked to implement the same core values.  I believe that our working together to promote our values through my candidacy will help organize more voters to engage in the political process, work with WFP, and me on the Council to achieve success on issues that advance racial, economic, and criminal justice in DC. 	Our values are in alignment. I am a Progressive. I need your support to win now and in the long term. I specifically want DC Working Families endorsement because it will show that I am a movement candidate, a fair elections candidate, an accountable to the people candidate. It would be my honor to have your endorsement.	Did not complete questionnaire
What does an inclusive democracy and governance in DC look like to you?	I will learn the issues of residents of all neighborhoods and organize them around the positions which will help advance Ward 4 residents.  Toward this goal, I will continually hold subject matter town halls on each critical issue at locations and times convenient for a cross section of residents in order to learn the range of issues from all vantage points.  I will seek to advertise sessions through DC TV and other methods to effectively notify the public about issues and hold Saturday or Sunday hours at a Ward office or various locations around the Ward.  I will maintain a continuous log stating my position and rationale on various issues/legislation and any lobbyists I've met with on the issues.	As someone who had to leave my childhood home because of relentless rent increases, whose elementary school saw violence and was under-resourced, and knowing how many people have been left behind as DC has become one of the wealthiest cities on earth, I worked as a server and a salesperson to make rent and I am running to serve the lowest wage earners and retirees and children. In a city of increasing inequality, I want all DC residents to be able to participate and to be heard. I will work to ensure that all DC residents to benefit from the growing economy. While DC is getting wealthier overall, too many are not benefiting from that growth. I will work against racism and will support affirmative steps to undo historical wrongs. And I think every person seeking DC office should run as a Fair Elections candidate to be accountable to everyday people. I am and I will be.	Did not complete questionnaire
What steps will you take to get big money out of politics and put the needs of working people first?	I will propose that any company who has contracts with DC make their political spending public.  I will also propose a requirement that Councilmembers report and make public political contributions received from any business directly or indirectly within 2 years before or after any vote on legislation that directly or indirectly affects the business.  I would also require Councilmembers to report investments or management involvement in companies on which they will be voting before and after any vote.	Having my campaign be publically funded is an important first step. It means that I will not be beholden to big developers and other donors but will focus on the needs of all people in DC. I will support legislation that increases transparency and accountability in government. And I will keep walking picket lines, standing with my brothers and sisters in the labor movement, and siding with working people in the Wilson Building and in the streets.    	Did not complete questionnaire
What does a caring economy in DC look like to you?	A caring economy starts with safe, secure, and affordable housing for all, focusing on DC's most needy residents by preserving and upgrading and building more public housing to provide the unfulfilled one for one replacement of public housing units eliminated over the past 30 years.  There is a more than a 30,000 unit deficit of housing affordable to existing residents with severely low household incomes of little more than $36,000 (family of 4) including DC's seniors who are more impoverished than national average and growing family homelessness.  A caring economy provides a racially equitable public school system as the foundation for economic success that eliminates the false notion that traditional public schools and charter schools are in competition as a reason to rob funding from faltering traditional public schools rather them strengthen them.   	A caring economy means that DC public school teachers and child care workers can afford to live in DC. It means the schools in Ward 7 and 8 will be as well-resourced as the schools in Ward 3. A caring economy in DC means that if a long-time resident of DC wants to stay in their apartment, they will not be pushed out by developers. A caring economy includes retirees and restaurant workers, who deserve to be able to live their best lives. A caring economy includes better transportation: people need to be able to get across the city safely and affordably. A caring economy includes publicly funded child development centers. A caring economy includes health care from birth to death " every resident should have affordable and accessible high quality health care available to them.  It also absolutely includes the right to a fair wage, the right to organize, the right to paid time off, paid sick days, paid family leave and most of all, a caring government that actually implements the rights of the citizens by working proactively with business and community.  	Did not complete questionnaire
How would you ensure our wealthiest residents and businesses pay their fair share?	I would reverse the 2014 law that lowered taxes on the wealthy and make DC's tax structure more progressive because low-wage workers pay higher overall tax rate than wealthy residents. I will advocate legislation to reduce the estate tax exemption and return it to the $2 million exemption, thereby raising nearly $20 million savings.  I would restrict Events DC from negotiating giveaway contracts like the recent entertainment complex contract where the Nationals will pay no additional rent and get all of nearly $23 million annual revenue produced by the entertainment complex.	For businesses I would do four things. First is that I would undo the tax cuts DC has given to businesses over the last two years, and I would restore business taxation to previous levels. Second is that I would eliminate corporate tax subsidies that cost us money but which do not create jobs or expand our economy. Third is that I would close loopholes that benefit powerful interests — like companies that claim to be “high tech” — yet which in no way help DC residents. Some of these companies have only a handful of employees here and employ no District residents. Others are not really high tech companies and do not need a tax break. Finally, I’d also recall subsidies given to companies who then renege on their commitments, such as the DC Line hotel and so many others.  For individuals I would look at tax rates and estate taxes. Our top tax rate for millionaires is less than one half (1/2) of a percentage point higher than for someone making $60,000. That’s ridiculous. I am for progressive taxation. It’s time to raise taxes on the people who have the most money. I will propose that DC raise taxes on people who make more than a half a million dollars per year. I would also vote to cap the estate tax threshold at $2 million or less. Councilmember Todd voted to set this threshold at $5.5 million — over 60 times the average DC resident’s annual income.	Did not complete questionnaire
How will you support full funding of the Birth To Three for All DC Act?	I will introduce legislation to discontinue the Qualified High Technology Company tax incentives which would free up about $40 million per year because there is no evidence that they produce economic development.  I would dedicate the revenue savings to funding the Birth to Three for All DC Act which needs up to $50 million annually.	I will fully fund the Birth to Three for All Act with the tax increases as noted above, by avoiding sole-source and other conflict-riddled major procurements, and by closing corporate loopholes.  To ensure that this law is fully funded, we should consider creating a dedicated stream of revenue for the bill. As a council member, I will work to identify and redirect funds and identify  new revenue sources for the District to ensure the District creates a dedidated stream of revenue for the bill. One possible avenue is to advocate for a more progressive tax code, including a higher marginal tax rate for individuals with incomes above $350,000 and a property tax surcharge for homes worth $2 million or more.  We can afford to fully fund this groundbreaking new law if DC's wealthiest residents make this important investment in our neediest children. I will also work to ensure that taxpayer dollars are not wasted on contracts granted to politically connected companies and individuals.  This money should be used to improve public services, not to reward wealthy donors.     	Did not complete questionnaire
What does a livable city in DC look like to you?	A livable DC requires job opportunities that allow everyone to support themselves and family.  I will fight to make DC an equal wage jurisdiction for tipped workers who are the lowest paid minimum wage workers in DC.  I will fight for legislation that requires chain stores to offer additional hours to current employees before hiring new employees and reforms workers' scheduling to require predictable hours.  I will reform DC Apprenticeship Council to ensure DC certifies only business that conduct fair pay practices.  I will fight for green jobs to retrofit deteriorating infrastructure, including fully funding replacing lead water service lines which are extremely detrimental to children and seniors.	A livable city is one where people can get to work easily, safely, and affordably at any time of day, no matter how they want to travel. It's a city where every person, of every income, can afford to live here working just one job without overtime. It's a city where public services are reliable and consistently high-quality, where agencies function well. A livable city is also one that systematically addresses the climate crisis in every aspect of its governance.  	Did not complete questionnaire
What steps will you take to support racial equity in housing, to help stop the displacement of Black and Brown families from the District?	I will fight to build new, retrofit existing public housing, and make good on promise of one-for-one replacement of public housing units DC eliminated; double percentage of affordable housing under inclusionary zoning and expand inclusionary zoning to downtown; expand rent control by eliminating voluntary agreements that negatively impact future tenants and bring newer buildings under rent control; fight for an agency dedicated to rental housing inspection and enforcement; and for greater enforcement against DC banks that redline and reverse redline (charging higher rates) against African American and Latino applicants compared to Whites, including enforcement against online banks and banks without physical offices in Black and Latino communities categories not covered by Community Reinvestment Act.  	We are in the midst of an affordable housing crisis and it's time to start acting like it. It is shocking and shameful that DC has the highest intensity of gentrification of any city in the country, and I would approach it in three ways. First is that we need to preserve every single affordable housing unit we have in every conceivable way. That starts with helping tenants buy the buildings they currently live in. DC has DOPA, the legal ability to buy buildings. But in recent years DOPA has not been used to save affordable housing. I would also build up programs that create and preserve affordable housing like the Housing Trust Fund (DC has one, but it needs to be bigger) and Community Land Trusts. I will expand current programs that help low income residents buy homes. And I will fight for strengthened, deepened, and expanded Rent Control and to close existing loopholes.   	Did not complete questionnaire
What steps will you take to protect our immigrant families and neighbors, from ICE and others?	I will make it a dischargeable offense for anyone in DC police chain of command to violate immigrants' right to liberty by cooperating with ICE by detaining immigrants for ICE pick up.  Educate immigrants on rights and available programs to regularize their status.	I will work to ensure that MPD does not ask for immigration status and does not provide data to ICE. I will work to ensure that the DC jail does not provide data to ICE and does not cooperate with ICE detainers. I will support an investigation into how and why DC employers have been collaborating with ICE to date.  I will work in solidarity with organizations and community fighting to protect immigrants' rights on a multitude of fronts. 	Did not complete questionnaire
What are your plans are to combat the lack of access to quality healthcare for residents in Southeast due to cuts in funding at United Medical Center?	I will advocate for greater racial equity by fully funding United Medical Center (only hospital in Wards 7 and 8) as a full service hospital until new hospital planned is opened.  UMC should offer specialty services, including reopening obstetrics and maternity services.  I will fight to protect union workers' jobs and for increased medical infrastructure in Southeast through funding/incentives for medical office buildings, retail health clinics, and urgent care facilities.	During my campaign I have spoken to neighbors, nurses, and healthcare experts and they all agree: our status quo is not working. DC has amongst the highest Black maternal death rates in the country. When I took my mom to the hospital a few months ago, they put us in the hallway for 18 hours. We are one of the wealthiest cities in the world and we can do better. DC has provided funding to build a new hospital but it will not be finished until 2023 or later. Until the new hospital is completed, we need to fully support United Medical Center.  I would push to restore funding to $40 million (it's at $20 million now) and maintain it until the new hospital is completed. I would work with fellow council members and administrators and community stakeholders to insure that the new hospital has high quality services " especially in obstetrics, and other care areas that are currently not available East of the River.  	Did not complete questionnaire
What does a safe community in DC look like to you?	A safe community is one in which there is equality of opportunity for all residents so they can envision and embark of a path to safe, secure, and affordable housing, education that is helping them grow and employment that provides opportunity to thrive without resort to risky or unhealthy behavior.  I will fight for apprenticeship and entrepreneurial training centers in Ward 4 instead of efforts to criminalize Black youth standing around Kennedy Street, NW because White people are fearful of them. 	In a safe community youth, seniors, and everyone in between can walk the streets and see their neighbors and friends. They can go about their lives without fear for their safety. When they see police, they can have confidence that they are there to de-escalate conflict and to keep *everyone* safe. Whenever there are incidents, violence interrupters, and others who have the proper training, expediently de-escalate any issues. When people need resources, they get them. We already have models that work for treating crime with a public health approach - such as the ACE Diversion program at the Office of the Attorney General - where on certain blocks in Wards 7 and 8 we've been able to reduce crime by assessing the housing, health, and job needs of offenders and getting them that help.  When we treat public health issues as such instead of mistaking them for problems solved with prison, we can actually achieve healthy, vibrant, safe communities for all throughout DC.    	Did not complete questionnaire
How will you support decarceration and efforts to build off of the NEAR Act to promote public health based solutions to community violence?	I will push for dedicated funding for the NEAR Act for many more violence interruption specialists to seek out individuals at risk individuals in order to learn their backgrounds,  neighborhood conditions, and skill/education needs.  I would require the NEAR Act to provide clients access to skilled craft apprenticeship training, entrepreneurship training and grants to start businesses.  I will fight against police in schools and against criminalizing  truancy and other behavioral matters and for better mental health infrastructure in schools.	I support building on the NEAR Act to promote public health based solutions to community violence. I support broadening funding for the violence interruption programs. I worked within DC's ACE-diversion program to suspend sentences and target services to first time offenders and help them avoid prison and give them a chance to turn their lives around. More 80% of people in the program did not ever re-offend. We need to use these sorts of smart-on-crime approaches to make us all safer.  	Did not complete questionnaire
What communities are often ignored when creating a safer DC and why?	African American and Latino youth and adults have their needs ignored and are treated as threats because of White people's fear of them.  Fear compels people to call for a police solution to noncriminal behavior.  I will advocate job training and other activities for out of school and out of work Black youth congregating along Kennedy Street rather than trying to get the police involved.  Over policing of Black and Latino people leads to more arrests, particularly for drugs, even though White people use and sell drugs at the same or higher rate than Black and Latino people.  Also the needs of LGBTQ people are ignored and their physical health is less protected. 	Brown, Black, immigrant, and transgender communities have often received less attention than they should as public safety is considered. Also the elderly, the homeless, and folks with varying abilities such as the deaf community for instance. Why? Because the most disenfranchised communities often aren't invited to the table and/or simply don't have time to be at the table because they are working and caretaking during the hours the DC Council has public hearings. They're often the most vulnerable with the least power within the system. As Councilmember for Ward 4, I would work with my staff, ANC commissioners, Democratic Party, Civic Associations, and community leaders to better inform the community about important issues under consideration at the council and how they can participate and lead in the democratic process. I would work to bring forums and hearings into the community and during more accessible hours. I will make time and my team will make time to make sure that our must left out community voices are heard. 	Did not complete questionnaire
How will you support Vision Zero?	I will push a public service campaign that promotes the importance of all modes of transportation that residents use and why they use each form.  I will also promote use of funds to emphasize enforcement of safety requirements with which pedestrians, drivers, bikers, and scooters must comply.	The DC Department of Transportation has done a good job investing in safe street infrastructure in recent years. We can and should do more. We need to dedicate more of our roadspace to bus lanes and safe, protected bike lanes. That will enable more people to get where they are going more safely. We should also encourage more people to choose transit by making it as easy, affordable, and convenient an option as possible. This will get more cars off the road, make streets safer, and reduce congestion and pollution. Additional changes like road diets and lane narrowing can also help along high-collision corridors. I look forward to working in partnership with safety experts, and to learning from the ways other cities are addressing this around the world.  The approach I'm least excited about is the Mayor's first solution of increasing traffic fines.  If a low income or middle class DC resident has a $200 fine and it doubles " that puts hard working people on the path to losing their apartment or not having enough food to eat. I am for strong enforcement of traffic laws and we should study the implementation of sliding scale tickets being used by other cities. 	Did not complete questionnaire
What steps would you take to address the school-to-prison pipeline in the District?	I will advocate greater funding to public schools for courses that draw out student creativity, provide culturally relevant courses, and place counselors and social workers in every school for mediation.  We must test for learning disabilities and offer remediation.  I will fight against police in schools, referrals to police, and zero tolerance discipline all of which discriminate against Black and Latino students.  I will drastically reduce suspensions and expulsions because they increase the drop-out rate. 	Most immediately I would expand the ACE diversion program that I mentioned earlier. This program can help youth who have made a bad choice get back on the path to school rather than prison. I also strongly believe in a comprehensive approach, beginning by investing in our youngest children by fully funding and implementing the Birth to Three for All DC Act. I would support and fully implement school-based mental health services at a ratio that makes sense: in some high-needs schools there should be one mental health professional for every 50 to 100 students. In addition, for years DCPS has been ignoring the set-aside for at-risk students – “At Risk Funds” — and diverting those funds to other things. Those funds should be going to at-risk youth and no one else. I would also like to explore the transformation of DC public schools into public community schools — where teachers, parents, students, administrators, and community stakeholders are visioning and implementing change together. Public community school models are working successfully in Baltimore, New York, Los Angeles and other cities across the nation	Did not complete questionnaire

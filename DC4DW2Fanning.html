We need to be knowledgeable about how we got our current tax system. &nbsp;In 2013, the DC Tax Revision Commission gave us our current inequitable tax structure; but when you look at who was on this commission (http://www.dctaxrevisioncommission.org/members) the outcome is less of a mystery. &nbsp;DC needs to convene a new Tax Revision Commission, but this time the commission should have membership that is more representative of the District population, including people making less than 30% of AMI. &nbsp;When you only allow people making six-figure salaries deciding tax policy, the District will never have a truly progressive tax structure, and the very wealthy will always come out on top.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c7 c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c7 c0"></span></p><h2 class="c8" id="h.3znysh7"><span class="c3">WORKERS&rsquo; RIGHTS</span></h2><p class="c6"><span class="c11 c0">2. DC has a proud history of passing landmark labor laws but a lackluster record of enforcing these laws or proactively informing workers about existing or new rights. What will you do as a CM to change this status quo and ensure there is strong oversight &amp; enforcement of worker rights?</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c11 c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Lack of enforcement of District laws and failings in oversight are nothing new to DC government, and DC labor laws are no exception. &nbsp;Oftentimes, members of the Council pass groundbreaking legislation, but fall short on providing specific details on how these laws should be enacted and enforced. &nbsp; However, I am encouraged by a series of recent lawsuits brought on by Attorney General Karl Racine&rsquo;s office, on behalf of District workers. &nbsp;I believe that the public prosecution of violations of the Districts labor laws will have a deterrent effect on employers, and help workers become more aware of their rights. Specifically, to address enforcement of DC labor laws, I would make sure that the DOES Office of Wage Hours is fully funded and has the proper number of inspector to carry out regular compliance checks of employers, and also has the staff on-hand to quickly resolve employee complaints. I also would like employees to be able to file a complaint just by just dialing 311. After spending some time on the DOES Office of Wage Hour Compliance</span><span>&nbsp;webpage (</span><span class="c2"><a class="c13" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://does.dc.gov/service/office-wage-hour-compliance&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573312258925000">https://does.dc.gov/service/office-wage-hour-compliance</a></span><span>)</span><span class="c7 c0">, it is clear that we need to make information regarding workers rights more accessible and make it easier for workers to report violators. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c9 c11"></span></p><h2 class="c8" id="h.2et92p0"><span class="c3">EDUCATION</span></h2><p class="c4"><span class="c11 c0">3. Publicly funded charter schools do not have the same transparency requirements as traditional DCPS schools including disclosing salaries, records, or vendor contracts less than $100,000 nor are charter schools required to have open meetings. Charter advocates argue that they lack the budget to comply with FOIA requests while open government advocates and parents want more access to information. Do you believe charters should be subject to FOIA? How would you resolve these opposing stances on charter school transparency?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c20">Charter schools, by their very nature, enjoy a certain level of autonomy, but this should not be mistaken for complete independence.&nbsp; I believe that all institutions supported in full or in part with District of Columbia tax dollars should be compliant with all D.C. Human Rights and FOIA laws. Understanding that individual charters schools may require more assistance from the DC Public Charter School Board complying with D.C. FOIA laws; I would support providing additional resources so that all Local Education Agencies (LEAs) are fully compliant. &nbsp;Funding for this mandate must be part of the solutions, because it would not be fair to students to increase class sizes or reduce instructional hours for a LEA to comply with FIOA requests.</span></p><h2 class="c8" id="h.tyjcwt"><span class="c3">HOUSING</span></h2><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c17">4.

If not, explain where you differ. What other ideas would you propose to help residents who are negatively impacted by rising rents?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7 c0">There are many aspects of the Reclaim Rent Control platform that I agree with, but in some areas, I do not believe it goes far enough toward combating housing affordability. The Council just introduced the Rental Housing Act Extension Amendment Act of 2019 that extends DC&rsquo;s rent control laws till 2030. &nbsp;While I support the extension of rent control till 2030, I believe the law should be expanded to include building built before 1995. I like the idea of having dynamic or sliding date in which buildings would come under rent control; I would support a date of 20 years, not 15 years. &nbsp;I would not restrict rent increases to CPI + 0%, however, I would use rental assistance funds to help seniors and those with incomes less than 30% AMI to keep net rent increases to CPI. &nbsp;The reason why I would not cap rent increases at the level of inflation, is that I do not want to create a scenario where landlords are tempted to scale back on routine maintenance and repairs, opting for short-term profitability through deferred maintenance, creating future slum conditions. Finally, the ability of a landlord to get around rent control rules by obtaining a voluntary agreement from at least 70% of a building&rsquo;s renters in order to raise rents for new residents, is a loophole that must be closed immediately.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c17 c0">5.

I believe in keeping public housing public and do not support the use of vouchers as a substitute for public housing. &nbsp;If elected to Council, I would introduce legislation that would call for a 1-for-1 replacement of our public housing stock; specifically, 3 and 4-bedroom family-sized units. &nbsp;I would also increase penalties for voucher discrimination from landlords, and I would also eliminate DC&rsquo;s annual tax sale. &nbsp;If we are in a housing shortage, can anyone explain to me why we are selling valuable properties to developers for pennies on the dollar, when those properties should be transferred to the DC Department of Housing and Community Development to meet our affordable housing needs.</span><span class="c7 c9">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c7 c9"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c7 c0">Each Ward should share, equally, the responsibility for creating 4,500 new housing units within their boundaries. I also believe that building affordable housing should be the priority. &nbsp;Historic development, high density and the high cost of land provide challenges for large-scale housing projects in Ward 2. &nbsp;Despite these constraints, I believe housing goals for Ward 2 can be achieved by:</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c7 c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c7 c0">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public/Private Partnerships with faith-based institutions to leverage land or under-utilized surface parking lots to create new housing opportunities in Ward 2. &nbsp;As an ANC Commissioner, I have worked with the New Bethany Baptist Church, Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) and a private developer to bring 48 units of senior housing to a church-owned lot located at 11th and N Street NW. &nbsp;In addition to creating much needed low-income senior housing in the Ward, the church was able to use proceeds from this project to fund the restoration of their house of worship. &nbsp;I have also participated in discussions with DHCD and the Vermont Avenue Baptist Church to bring new housing opportunities to two lots that the church owns on 12th and Q Street NW and Vermont and R Street NW. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c7 c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c7 c0">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Building housing on District-owned property. We need a survey of District-owned properties that are currently underbuilt and could support housing. &nbsp;One location where I would consider building new housing is the District Recorder of Deeds Building located on 515 D Street NW. &nbsp;There are many opportunities to build on District-owned properties, but the city lacks a comprehensive strategy for how we should use publicly owned properties to address our housing shortage.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c7 c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c7 c0">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ADUs and tiny homes offer the cheapest and most effective way to increase Ward 2&rsquo;s affordable housing stock, and I would support using government incentives and tax breaks to encourage residential homeowners to build more ADUs and tiny houses on their property.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c7 c0"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c5" id="h.3dy6vkm"><span class="c3"></span></p><h2 class="c8"><span class="c3">GOVERNMENT/ETHICS</span></h2><p class="c4"><span class="c11 c0">6. Are you participating in Fair Elections? If not, why not? What other ideas would you propose to limit the influence of money in politics?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7 c0">Yes. I think the first step in removing big money out of politics is participation in the Fair Elections Program; and I have done that. The second is banning outside employment for members of the Council; and I pledge to be a full-time Councilmember. &nbsp;The third is to enact term limits; the people voted for term limits once and the council overturned that decision, which includes the incumbent. &nbsp;I am not going to promise to resign after two terms, because other Councilmembers have made that promise when they first ran for office. &nbsp;I promise that will actively support and campaign for a second referendum on term limits and would not overturn the will of the people if elected to office.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c11 c0">7.

Will you commit to vote for Vote16DC?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7 c0">Unsure. &nbsp;While I like the idea of greater youth participation in politics especially around climate issues. I&rsquo;m not sure how to reconcile lowering the voting age to 16 while advocating for the Incarceration Reduction Amendment Act of 2016 or the Second Look Amendment Act of 2019, which allows individuals to petition the courts for reconsideration of their sentences due to their youthfulness during the commission of a violent crime. &nbsp;I am hesitant to support any legislation that might be used to erode the protections afforded to juveniles, such a separate juvenile justice system, or having juvenile records sealed. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c11 c0">9. Since DC frequently has races with many candidates in which the winner gets far less than a majority of the votes, would you support implementing ranked choice voting or some other method to ensure some level of majority support?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7 c0">Yes.

For example, I did not support proposition 77; however, I believe it was wrong of the Council to overturn a ballot initiative that was approved by the voters. &nbsp;In 1994, DC voters approved a ballot initiative to institute term limits, but The D.C.

I supported the passage of the NEAR Act and was appalled with the recent release of MPD&rsquo;s stop-and-frisk data. &nbsp;The racial disparity in the number of people of color that have been stopped by the police is just another form of racial profiling. &nbsp;I would like MPD to also collect data regarding the race of the officers conducting stops. &nbsp;If elected to the Council, I would require MPD officers to have cultural competence and diversity training, requiring certification every 2 years. &nbsp;In terms of collecting and disseminating data required by the NEAR Act. &nbsp;I would introduce legislation that would require MPD to submit data to both the DC Auditor and the Office of the Attorney General. &nbsp;The Office of the Attorney general would be the responsible body that would then make that data available to the public. &nbsp;At our most recent ANC 2F meeting that was attended by the Mayor, MPD does not have the systems in place to make data available below the police district or PSA level. &nbsp;I would make sure that there was money in the budget to create a robust data system where the information could be made more readily available and in a useful format.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c11 c0">13. What public health policy ideas would you propose to reduce violence in DC?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7 c0">We need and deserve the holistic and comprehensive approach to public safety that the NEAR Act prioritizes. For healthy communities, we need to recognize that there is a bigger picture that includes police, social service agencies, and others to collaborate for the benefit of all. &nbsp;We are never going to arrest our way out of the problem. The cycle of hopelessness needs to be broken.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7 c0">Public safety is important to me, and where I will be a strong advocate is in the following areas:</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7 c0">Supporting Social Services: For us to have social service partners, we need to fund and staff the agencies that are best capable to engage on homelessness, addiction, and domestic violence. The Department of Behavioral Health, for example, is a small staff with limited funding &ndash; yet must serve the entire District. They do not have the support they need to make the difference in neighborhood safety they otherwise could. We must provide the support and staffing they need.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7 c0">Collaboration: We need to create a framework where calls for service result in both a police response and a social service response. It is impossible to tell which service is required more when calls come in and it doesn&rsquo;t serve us well when we don&rsquo;t have the correct support response. We need to strengthen communication between the agencies, so that all who are engaged to improve a community&rsquo;s public health have all the relevant information they need to do so. </span></p><h2 class="c8" id="h.2s8eyo1"><span class="c3">IMMIGRATION</span></h2><p class="c6"><span class="c11 c0">14.

Given Pepco&rsquo;s resistance to transitioning to clean renewable energy, do you think DC would benefit from municipally owned electricity?

Ultimately, I believe the economics of clean renewable energy will win the day, but until then we must work with tools available to us, such as the DC Public Service Commission. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c7"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c11 c0">16.

Finally, if elected; I would introduce legislation that would direct more revenues from sports betting revenue, the current $5 million is far below what the public was led to believe would be generated by legalizing gambling in the District.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c7 c0"></span></p><h2 class="c8" id="h.26in1rg"><span class="c3">BACKGROUND</span></h2><p class="c4"><span class="c17 c0">18. </span><span class="c17 c0 c18">(Ward 2 challengers only)</span><span class="c11 c0">&nbsp;Are you committed to removing the incumbent from office?

I don&rsquo;t think contribution totals should be used, as the whole point of the Fair Election program was to reduce the influence of money in politics; however, I would use the number or percentage of contributions coming from Ward 2 residents as a measure for determining the best candidate. Record of public service and history of civic activism should also be considered.

This chart (source: </span><span class="c19 c25"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://itep.org/whopays/washington-dc/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573312279441000">https://itep.org/whopays/washington-dc/</a></span><span class="c3 c6">) shows the current tax structure for DC households (including sales, property, and income taxes). Do you think this is a fair tax structure? If so, explain why. If not, explain why and how you would improve it.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">I don&rsquo;t think this is a fair tax structure because it puts an inequitable burden on lower and middle-income residents. I believe we&rsquo;re at an inflection point in the District: we&rsquo;re at risk of becoming a place where only the very wealthy can afford to live, at the same time that the wealthiest 5 percent of residents are paying a lower share of their income in taxes than the middle 50 percent</span><span class="c3 c1">. But when I talk to Ward 2 residents, it&rsquo;s clear that many of us don&rsquo;t want to keep going down this path. We can make choices now to help ensure we have a more progressive and equitable city in the years and decades to come: meaning a place that is diverse, inclusive and welcoming to people of all incomes, races, and backgrounds. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c5">To me, the best way to build a more equitable city is by </span><span class="c4">making structural changes that address the basic needs of residents rather than effectively leaving individual families to fend for themselves. </span><span class="c4 c5">As Ward 2&rsquo;s councilmember, I will focus on these kinds of structural changes that will make it easier for all people &ndash; </span><span class="c1">from fifth generation DC residents like me to our immigrant communities and other new arrivals</span><span class="c4 c5">&nbsp;&ndash; to stay and thrive in the homes and neighborhoods that they love. That means taking concrete steps to make it possible for everyone in DC to afford a place to live, find high-quality child care for their kids, walk, bike and take public transit all across the city, and pay off student loan debt &ndash; which disproportionately disadvantages Black and Brown families and exacerbates the racial wealth gap. That also means implementing a fairer tax structure by repealing or clawing back the corporate tax breaks that have been championed by Jack Evans for years &ndash; and that cost the District tens of millions of dollars a year</span><span class="c3 c1">&nbsp;&ndash; and exploring new funding sources that involve the wealthiest paying their fair share. </span></p><h2 class="c17" id="h.3znysh7"><span class="c3 c6">WORKERS&rsquo; RIGHTS</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c6">2. DC has a proud history of passing landmark labor laws but a lackluster record of enforcing these laws or proactively informing workers about existing or new rights. What will you do as a CM to change this status quo and ensure there is strong oversight &amp; enforcement of worker rights?</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Many members of the DC Council too often treat passing a law or holding a press conference as the end of the process, rather than the beginning. In my career in public service over the past decade, including </span><span class="c4">working in DC&rsquo;s Medicaid agency, DC&rsquo;s federal trial court, the U.S. Senate, and two different federal agencies, </span><span class="c3 c1">I have learned the vital importance of continued oversight and accountability to ensure that laws and protections on the books actually make a difference in the day-to-day lives of residents. I have also learned how effective oversight can simultaneously protect residents and save money. For example, I was awarded the Department of Justice Civil Division&rsquo;s Perseverance Award for my work during the Obama Administration on an investigation that not only resulted in a strong, enforceable corporate integrity agreement to protect patient safety but also returned nearly $155 million to taxpayers. Similarly, my oversight efforts when I worked in the U.S. Senate not only helped protect health care coverage for low-income people benefitting from a little-known provision of the Affordable Care Act, it also forced the Trump Administration to provide millions of dollars to the states choosing to use it. </span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c3 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">Rather than the current practice of some members of the Council to wait for a tragedy, a news story, or the executive branch &ndash; or all three &ndash; to spur action, I would fight for proactive oversight of worker protections from my first day on the job. For example, the Council should, as a matter of course, proactively plan for accountability hearings and check-in mechanisms for every significant deadline included in labor (or other major) legislation that becomes law. If necessary, I would fight to include triggers and claw back provisions to ensure compliance not only with these deadlines and requirements, but also with open or unaddressed recommendations from the Offices of the Inspector General and DC Auditor. </span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c3 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I believe the Council should also enact a mechanism to review the use, or lack of use, of all the enforcement, oversight, and accountability tools it has provided to the executive branch over the years. Although DC &ldquo;</span><span class="c2"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.dcjwj.org/project/makinglawsreal/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573312279443000">has</a></span><span class="c1">&nbsp;some of the strongest labor laws on the books&rdquo; and the Council passed the Wage Theft Prevention Amendment Act in 2014, the DC Just Pay Coalition has </span><span class="c2"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.dcjwj.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/LawsReal.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573312279443000">found</a></span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&ldquo;wage theft remains pervasive&rdquo; and the Department of Employment Services &ldquo;is not using the full extent of the law to ensure workers are fully paid&rdquo; or effectively deterring bad faith employers &ldquo;from being out of compliance with this or other labor laws.&rdquo; One can imagine similarly lackluster implementation or enforcement may take place with respect to the Universal Paid Leave Amendment Act, particularly in light of recent proposed regulations that would</span><span class="c2"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://jufj.org/pfl-regs/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573312279443000">&nbsp;inappropriately narrow</a></span><span class="c3 c1">&nbsp;the number of workers who could receive benefits. In short, the Council should explicitly provide for systematic and proactive assessments of the use and effectiveness of the enforcement tools it has passed into law to ensure that they are actually being put to their intended use to improve the lives of workers in the District. If they aren&rsquo;t, the DC Auditor or other reviewing bodies should provide specific recommendations to the Council for how to make sure they do. </span></p><h2 class="c17" id="h.2et92p0"><span class="c3 c6">EDUCATION</span></h2><p class="c12"><span class="c3 c6">3. Publicly funded charter schools do not have the same transparency requirements as traditional DCPS schools including disclosing salaries, records, or vendor contracts less than $100,000 nor are charter schools required to have open meetings. Charter advocates argue that they lack the budget to comply with FOIA requests while open government advocates and parents want more access to information. Do you believe charters should be subject to FOIA? How would you resolve these opposing stances on charter school transparency?</span></p><p class="c12" id="h.tyjcwt"><span class="c4">The use of public dollars should be accompanied by public accountability. This includes applying the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) equally to charter schools, which educate nearly half of DC students. I found EmpowerEd and the Washington Teachers Union very compelling on these points at the April DC4D meetup. If elected, I would support Councilmember Charles Allen&rsquo;s Public School Transparency Amendment Act to equalize the transparency requirements between the traditional and charter public school sectors. I have not seen persuasive evidence that doing so would result in an overwhelming financial or administrative burden for charter schools in the District. In fact, the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools </span><span class="c2"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.publiccharters.org/sites/default/files/migrated/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/2016ModelCharterSchoolLaw.pdf%23page%3D30&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573312279444000">lists</a></span><span class="c4">&nbsp;compliance with freedom of information statutes in its model laws and has </span><span class="c2"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/should-charter-schools-be-subject-to-open-record-laws/2019/10/09/d9ad1a84-e60d-11e9-b403-f738899982d2_story.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573312279444000">said</a></span><span class="c3 c1">&nbsp;that &ldquo;in most jurisdictions, the public can attend charter-school board meetings and request records from individual schools.&rdquo; To resolve opposing stances on this issue, I would be open to adding a provision to Councilmember Allen&rsquo;s bill requiring the Council to reevaluate the policy after a set amount of time if reliable evidence emerges showing that equalizing transparency requirements is having major negative impacts on DC students. </span></p><h2 class="c17"><span class="c3 c6">HOUSING</span></h2><p class="c12"><span class="c19">4.

Do you support their </span><span class="c25 c19"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://reclaimrentcontrol.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Rent-Control-Policy-One-Pager.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573312279445000">platform</a></span><span class="c3 c6">&nbsp;in its entirety? If not, explain where you differ. What other ideas would you propose to help residents who are negatively impacted by rising rents?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">I support most of the sensible reforms </span><span class="c2"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://reclaimrentcontrol.org/who-we-are/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573312279445000">proposed</a></span><span class="c4">&nbsp;by the Reclaim Rent Control Coalition. First, we should not be providing an incentive for landlords to push tenants out of their units in the form of vacancy increases; if anything, landlords should be incentivized to retain longtime tenants. Second, hardship petitions should be permitted only where absolutely necessary by making them narrower, more tailored, and temporary. Third, we should implement stronger oversight of all petitions for exemptions from rent control, including better and more frequent audits and requiring proof of general compliance with the housing code as a prerequisite. Fourth, building eligibility for rent control should be tied to a dynamic date rather than staying the same for decades on end. Finally, landlords for market-rate housing should be restricted to one rent increase a year to strengthen baseline protections for tenants who do not currently benefit from rent control. That said, I do not support capping annual rent increases at the level of inflation and eliminating the additional 2 percent allowed under current law. Other states that have recently enacted strong rent control reforms &ndash; such as </span><span class="c2"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/11/business/economy/california-rent-control.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573312279445000">California and Oregon</a></span><span class="c3 c1">&nbsp;&ndash; have allowed for rent increases above inflation. I&rsquo;m concerned that this well-intentioned provision of the Reclaim Rent Control Coalition platform could lead to insufficient maintenance and upgrades at rent-controlled buildings. </span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c3 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In addition to </span><span class="c4">reauthorizing and strengthening rent control, we must take additional actions to help residents struggling with our housing affordability crisis. </span><span class="c4 c5">First, we should press for significant investments in housing that low-income and middle-income residents can afford.

Specifically, the Council should invest in additional housing inspectors and demand stronger oversight (and conduct stronger oversight itself) to ensure that landlords are maintaining safe and livable units and do not exploit or unjustly evict tenants. These efforts could be implemented fairly quickly at relatively low cost, would help identify areas where misspent tax dollars could be recovered and/or redirected, and &ndash; most importantly &ndash; would put the day-to-day experiences and welfare of DC residents front and center. </span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c3 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Finally, we must do more for the many Ward 2 residents experiencing homelessness &ndash; including treating them as our neighbors, not as a nuisance.

We should use this data to help guide reform efforts to prevent many of the unjust arrests and convictions that lead to incarceration. The NEAR Act also promotes community policing, which emphasizes officers developing relationships and building trust in the neighborhoods they patrol and can result in better outcomes for both law enforcement and the community.

Further, federal authorities often fail to coordinate with the DC government when releasing those in its custody. None of this federal involvement in our local affairs actually helps reduce violence in DC. </span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c3 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Finally, we must improve the systems and processes for connecting returning citizens to the DC services for which they qualify, from enrolling in housing assistance and Medicaid to receiving job training and other supports. As I saw when I worked for a DC agency that is making it easier for all residents to enroll in these kind of benefits, returning citizens can face particularly difficult challenges navigating the bureaucracy. As a member of the DC Council, I would focus on ensuring that efforts like the recently </span><span class="c2"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://washingtoninformer.com/d-c-helps-returning-citizens-with-ready-assistance/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573312279469000">established</a></span><span class="c4">&nbsp;READY Center, which is intended to serve as a &ldquo;one-stop shop&rdquo; for these services and supports, are making a meaningful difference. Reconnecting returning citizens with family and friends, seamlessly enrolling them in the services they need to get back on their feet, and facilitating smooth re-entry into the community and the workforce will go a long way to creating a safer DC for all. </span></p><h2 class="c17" id="h.4d34og8"><span class="c3 c6">IMMIGRATION</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c6">14. Do you support legislation to prohibit the District from cooperating with federal immigration agencies, including by complying with detainer requests, absent a judicial warrant or order?</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Yes. I also support legislation to </span><span class="c4 c5 c26">increase funding for attorneys to help undocumented DC residents</span><span class="c3 c1">. More broadly, the District should conduct a top-to-bottom review of all data sharing with the federal government to address other ways in which immigrant families and neighbors may be vulnerable. For example, the Trump Administration&rsquo;s cruel attempts to punish immigrants who use basic government services &ndash; such as the proposed &ldquo;public charge&rdquo; or &ldquo;mixed status&rdquo; rules &ndash; affect key DC health, housing, and other benefit programs that involve extensive collaboration with the federal government. </span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c3 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c3">We must do better when it comes to locally funded programs as well. DC implemented a rule in 2011 requiring participants in the Healthcare Alliance program, which primarily serves immigrants who cannot otherwise obtain health care coverage, to recertify their eligibility every six months rather than once a year like most other programs. When I oversaw a division of the District&rsquo;s Medicaid agency, I saw the harms of this rule firsthand, as participants often must miss work and wait for hours on end to avoid losing their health insurance. I strongly support eliminating this unequal treatment. </span></p><h2 class="c17" id="h.2s8eyo1"><span class="c3 c6">ENVIRONMENT</span></h2><p class="c12"><span class="c3 c6">15.

The pledge includes a commitment to &ldquo;support legislation for an economic feasibility study on the implementation of alternative utility models such as Community Choice Aggregation and municipalization in DC,&rdquo; in addition to rejecting campaign contributions from and disclosing all meetings with Pepco, Washington Gas, and other fossil fuel companies. If I&#39;m elected, I&#39;ll make decisions about environmental policy based on the merits, not based on contributions from fossil fuel corporations or secret meetings with their lobbyists.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c3 c6">16. What specific legislative initiatives will you introduce in Council Period 24 to protect DC from the effects of climate change?</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c4">First and foremost, I will engage in proactive oversight to ensure effective and transparent implementation of the Clean Energy DC Omnibus Amendment Act that was signed into law in January.

Canvassing and other campaign tactics to meet residents where they are should not stop on Election Day. As a councilmember, I will continue to have meet and greets, knock on residents&rsquo; doors, and ask for constituent feedback at Metro stations, farmers markets, and other community events. I will also host &ldquo;office hours&rdquo; in every neighborhood in the ward.

That means ensuring unions and working families have a prominent voice in decisions about establishing a fair minimum wage, tax policy, and paid family leave. That means restoring voting rights to residents who have been involved in the criminal justice system and lowering the voting age to 16. That means signing the No Pepco Pledge &ndash; refusing contributions from fossil fuel corporations or their lobbyists and being open and transparent about meetings with them. And that means robust implementation of campaign finance reforms like Fair Elections and the District&rsquo;s new clean elections law to ban pay-to-play campaign contributions from those seeking large government contracts. </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c3 c1">At the end of the day, I believe that being an effective councilmember means fighting for inclusion so that we have a government where decisions are based on the policy merits and the lived experiences of all our constituents, not the narrow preferences of those who can cut the biggest checks.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><div><p class="c7 c24"><span class="c3 c23"></span></p></div></body></html>

I pushed for more funding for schools and for at-risk students and pushed back against funding cuts, even hidden cuts, such as shifting security costs under individual school budgets - cuts which disproportionately hurt low income black and brown students. Funding intended for at-risk students has been misused and is insufficient to help those in need.

I know how vital it is. I support the core components of the Reclaim Rent Control platform, and I am a strong advocate for the reauthorization of DC&rsquo;s rent control law. My thoughts regarding the three components of the platform are as follows: <br></span></p><ol class="c26 lst-kix_list_4-0 start" start="1"><li class="c10 c11"><span class="c16 c34">Expand rent control to protect more tenants</span><span class="c16">: &nbsp;I support expanding rent control to more units. I believe the most impactful way to do this is via incremental change. Expanding rent control can also include properties that were built before 2005 or include 4-unit buildings - but should be done incrementally with a transition based on data for how best to transition. I strongly agree with allowing only one rent increase per year for all DC rental units as suggested in the platform. </span></li></ol><p class="c5 c33"><span class="c0"></span></p><ol class="c26 lst-kix_list_4-0" start="2"><li class="c10 c11"><span class="c34 c16">Close loopholes in the existing law to stop the loss of affordable housing</span><span class="c16">: I fully support all subcomponents of associated with this part of the platform. &nbsp;</span></li></ol><p class="c5 c33"><span class="c0"></span></p><ol class="c26 lst-kix_list_4-0" start="3"><li class="c10 c11"><span class="c34 c16">Keep rent-controlled housing affordable for current tenants</span><span class="c16">: &nbsp;I agree with eliminating the vacancy incentive for landlords. I agree that keeping rent-controlled housing affordable for current tenants is of the utmost importance. In order to make sure that DC&rsquo;s rent-controlled housing is high quality and accurately meets health and safety standards, I support keeping CPI + 2%, rather than 0%, so that landlords have a revenue stream for making important health and safety improvements. </span></li></ol><p class="c10"><span class="c16"><br></span><span class="c7">Increase the housing supply, especially affordable housing: &nbsp;</span><span class="c16">I also think it is imperative that we take action to increase the housing supply--especially affordable housing--by building new units. &nbsp;A </span><span class="c16"><a class="c3" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/100946/meeting_the_washington_regions_future_housing_needs_0.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573312327306000">recent study</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;by the Urban Institute recommends 374,000 new units of housing region-wide by 2030 to close the affordability gap and meet the market demands. &nbsp;So far, I&rsquo;ve proposed the following solutions:</span></p><ul class="c26 lst-kix_list_3-0 start"><li class="c11 c20"><span class="c0">Allow individual homeowners to build Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs) on their property. I have had experience and success advocating for ADUs in Ward 2. These ADUs of course have to pass inspection and be safe for tenants and would be subject to the rules/restrictions on short-term housing. But such changes could incentivize hundreds of homeowners to create affordable units.</span></li><li class="c15 c11"><span class="c0">Building more housing above retail spaces. There are several locations that could work. Just one example is the Safeway on Wisconsin Ave. It should have had housing built on it, and maybe it still can. Just a block away, another grocery store recently opened with housing above. Both are on a major transportation corridor. There are many other such opportunities in Ward 2. It is important that such developments have good access to existing transit or that more transportation options be made available to serve more people.</span></li><li class="c15 c11"><span class="c0">On DC-owned land in and near Ward 2, the District should consider building more affordable units.</span></li><li class="c15 c11"><span class="c0">As telecommuting, co-working, and gig-economy work rises, and traditional office space becomes underused, I would like to incentivize building affordable housing units in these spaces. Others have proposed using vacant office space in Ward 2 for affordable childcare. Both are important affordability priorities that can potentially both be served well and co-located in certain cases.</span></li><li class="c15 c11"><span class="c0">I would also support incrementally allowing more rowhouses and small apartment buildings near major transit corridors in Northwest DC, while simultaneously beefing up transit options and availability and reliability, including dedicated bus lanes - something I&rsquo;ve been pushing for almost a decade.</span></li></ul><p class="c5"><span class="c9 c7 c6"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c7">5.

DC4D has endorsed a </span><span class="c2 c19"><a class="c3" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/demand-dc-housing-authority-to-preserve-public-housing-and-residents-rights&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573312327307000">petition </a></span><span class="c7">to DCHA with recommendations on protecting tenants. Have you signed the petition; if not, why not? What other policies would you propose to protect and/or expand public housing and housing for very low-income residents in DC?</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16">Maintaining public housing is one of my top priorities, and I will work tirelessly to ensure that we not only improve the quality of public housing but also increase the amount of housing in Ward 2. &nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c4">Residents of all income levels should have the opportunity to find housing and keep our city accessible for diverse groups of people. This should be a citywide goal. &nbsp;Having represented and been a homeowner in two different parts of Ward 2, I understand the challenges and am committed to more affordable housing in Ward 2.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16">To get this done, we must increase funding for the Housing Production Trust Fund. &nbsp;But, we also need more transparency and accountability to make sure that the Fund is maximally impactful. &nbsp;Too many projects have been approved that don&rsquo;t provide enough housing for the most needy. Many more units could have been created with the same funding and I am committed to doing more with our precious housing funds. Strong oversight would </span><span class="c16 c4">include ensuring that site visits are executed, and that sites are submitting their required annual certifications.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0">We also need to utilize an important tool: rent control. All families and people deserve high-quality, affordable homes. I support reauthorization of rent control as it currently standing and further protecting the rights of tenants. A critical part of this is eliminating loopholes that are misused by landlords such as hardship petitions. This has enabled properties to become dilapidated. This is unacceptable, and is something that I will work to change as Councilmember. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0">Greenleaf Gardens absolutely needs drastic reform. I fully support rebuilding the public housing into safe, healthy, and dignified high-quality units. While rebuilding, we need to make sure that the current tenants are protected, displacement will be minimized, and D.C. Housing Authority has a clear plan for rebuilding these units. The reposition plan as it stands does not ensure that tenants are protected.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c9 c7 c6"></span></p><h2 class="c10 c17" id="h.3rdcrjn"><span class="c9 c7">GOVERNMENT/ETHICS</span></h2><p class="c5"><span class="c9 c7"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c7">6.

I have long been in support of changing the incentives through public financing (or something like the &ldquo;democracy dollars&rdquo; program in Seattle). Removing barriers for residents to run for office is one of the best ways to encourage underrepresented voices in public office. </span></p><p class="c8 c33"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c0">That is why I talk about the Fair Elections Program often. Sometimes residents question this use of tax dollars. But I tell them what I told the council: &nbsp;our current system results in too much corporate welfare and unwarranted tax breaks that got enacted because of the skewed incentives corporations benefit from under the campaign finance system. Fair Elections will curb those incentives and likely save much more money than is spent - so we can spend our tax dollars more wisely to benefit all DC residents - especially those who need help the most.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c7 c9">7.

I agree that government agencies can/should act faster for residents in a crisis. For select services and agencies, I would work to streamline operations, to get speed up responses in crisis situations (utilities being shut off, eviction support, referrals to social services, referrals to counselors and case workers, etc.), and publicly-funded social services organizations can also help fill gaps in the social safety net.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0">But for the last 6 years I worked to help vulnerable residents and I know we need to &nbsp;strengthen our social safety net. There should be more funding to help support residents in need and in crisis - our social safety net has too many holes for far too many to fall through.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0">For the last 6 years I helped people in danger of being evicted or even dying if they did not get their health care needs covered - quickly. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0">Every week I received calls from councilmembers about constituents in need.

That is one of the reasons I hope to join the Judiciary Committee as councilmember.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0">I strongly supporting this bill for a number of reasons. First, studies have shown that by lowering the voting age, children are more likely to remain politically engaged into adulthood. A more informed electorate, overall, benefits public policy. Additionally, Vote16DC promotes community unity. As students become engaged at an earlier age, students start paying attention to pressing issues facing their neighborhoods.

I support requiring DCPS to submit an annual report explaining their use of funding for at-risk students so that we can hold DCPS accountable for how it uses these funds.<br><br>We also must think harder about reforming school discipline policies--especially those that engender the racial discipline gap. &nbsp;This is particularly relevant in DC, as Black students in DC are almost 12x more likely to be disciplined compared to white students.</span></p><p class="c10 c4"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c10 c4"><span class="c12">We also must close the opportunity gap.

Keeping our immigrants safe is a priority. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0">No one should live in fear.

I personally helped many immigrants get health insurance through this program.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0">But only half of participants apply for renewal when they are eligible. Lack of healthcare and other public benefits has detrimental and painful effects on the health and well being of this immigrant population. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0">This must change. As council person, I will launch an education campaign to educate city workers on the limited ways in which they have to cooperate with ICE. This importantly includes protecting our students in schools to make sure that their records are never released to ICE agents. It also means opening up a dialogue and continuing education program with the police force.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class="c10 c17 c18" id="h.35nkun2"><span class="c0"></span></h2><p class="c8"><span class="c22 c30"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c22 c30"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c22 c30"></span></p><h2 class="c10 c17" id="h.1ksv4uv"><span class="c9 c7">ENVIRONMENT</span></h2><p class="c5"><span class="c9 c7"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c7">15.

That&rsquo;s why full funding and full implementation of the Birth-to-Three for All Act is so essential. Cultivating the creation of affordable daycare and early education programs fosters a number of benefits for DC families: it allows parents to begin or return to work; it promotes healthy development, thereby helping avoid interventions, such as special education and grade repetition, later in life; and, over time, it can help close the achievement gap between children of color and white children. DC families deserve this investment into the lives of our young children&mdash;and that begins with supporting the implementation of the Birth-to-Three for All Act.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c22 c14 c4"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c22 c14 c4">Finding funding and creating dedicated funding for this will be one of my top priorities.

Such a taskforce would bring together all stakeholders&mdash;including lawmakers, policymakers, advocates, and residents&mdash;to work on various aspects of affordability, such as housing, childcare, food, transportation, education, etc. &nbsp;It would advise policymakers to, as much as possible, not tackle these problems separately, but rather in a coordinated fashion so that we aren&rsquo;t letting one problem get worse while focusing on another.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1 c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c9 c7 c6"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c9 c7 c6"></span></p><h2 class="c10 c17" id="h.2jxsxqh"><span class="c9 c7">BACKGROUND</span></h2><p class="c8"><span class="c9 c19 c28"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c7">18. </span><span class="c7 c27">(Ward 2 challengers only)</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;Are you committed to removing the incumbent from office?

DC residents could create a petition to voice their concerns or frustrations with specific issues or bills. &nbsp;And if the number of signatures reaches an established threshold, it will mandate the DC Council to respond. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c16">Recently I co-authored my first </span><span class="c2"><a class="c3" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.change.org/p/mayor-bowser-private-schools-should-not-have-exclusive-rights-to-public-fields-makejelleffpublic&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573312327345000">online petition</a></span><span class="c16">&nbsp;for fair sharing of public facilities - specifically the Jelleff Field. </span><span class="c7">It has almost 3,000 signatures and not only did Mayor Bowser meet with us about it, but the DC Council held a </span><span class="c2 c19"><a class="c3" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://nwc.news/jelleff-field-saga-intensifies-with-100-plus-testimonies-at-d-c-council-hearing/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573312327345000">big hearing</a></span><span class="c7">&nbsp;about it as well. </span><span class="c0">We are still fighting for justice, but the petition was a valuable tool and I believe it should be formalized in our government as President Obama did.

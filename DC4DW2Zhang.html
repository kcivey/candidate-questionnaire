This chart (source: </span><span class="c21"><a class="c20" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://itep.org/whopays/washington-dc/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573442690130000">https://itep.org/whopays/washington-dc/</a></span><span class="c0">) shows the current tax structure for DC households (including sales, property, and income taxes). Do you think this is a fair tax structure? If so, explain why. If not, explain why and how you would improve it.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">DC pays more than any state per capita in federal taxes. It would be valuable to look at local taxes in conjunction with federal taxes, to comprehensively assess how much each income bracket is paying in total taxes. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">Before making changes to the tax structure, we should better understand cause and effect (e.g., if a tax decrease on one group and increase on another will enhance the current state and not have unintended negative consequences) and assess whether the money can be derived from the current budget. Funding should be going to priority and near-term initiatives.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">The tax structure (and any incentives) needs to be structured in a way that does not place an unfair burden on low-income households, and, at the same time, promotes diverse economic development (e.g., encourages small business owners to establish their businesses in DC and stay, and hire locally). It also needs to be mindful of potential unintended consequences.</span></p><h2 class="c12" id="h.3znysh7"><span class="c17">WORKERS&rsquo; RIGHTS</span></h2><p class="c11"><span class="c0">2. DC has a proud history of passing landmark labor laws but a lackluster record of enforcing these laws or proactively informing workers about existing or new rights. What will you do as a CM to change this status quo and ensure there is strong oversight &amp; enforcement of worker rights?</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">If elected as a CM, several actions are important to the enforcement of worker rights. This includes, but not limited to:</span></p><ul class="c18 lst-kix_list_5-0 start"><li class="c2"><span class="c7">Maintain an open line with communication with community leaders, advocates, and non-profits.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c7">Collaborate and build relationships with the appropriate agencies, in addition to oversight.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c7">Ensure that our laws are proactive. It is important to continuously identify gaps in current legislation and potential unintended consequences.&nbsp;</span></li></ul><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c12" id="h.2et92p0"><span class="c17">EDUCATION</span></h2><p class="c3"><span class="c0">3. Publicly funded charter schools do not have the same transparency requirements as traditional DCPS schools including disclosing salaries, records, or vendor contracts less than $100,000 nor are charter schools required to have open meetings. Charter advocates argue that they lack the budget to comply with FOIA requests while open government advocates and parents want more access to information. Do you believe charters should be subject to FOIA? How would you resolve these opposing stances on charter school transparency?</span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c7">I support greater transparency for publicly funded charter schools, which serve almost half of all public school students in DC.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c7">The DC Public Charter School Board (DCPCSB) is subject to FOIA. DCPCSB collects information from the charter schools, and could potentially play a role in developing a standard for transparency and disseminating the appropriate information.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c7">We need to better understand what charter schools need to be able to be more transparent and respond to requests. Is the need for an additional staff member, training for someone currently on staff who could do it but doesn&rsquo;t have the skill-set, or something else?&nbsp;We can strike a balance between the information that is needed to help the public understand public charter school operations, and still provide the space for public charter schools to do what they need to do to focus on the students and be successful.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c7">In the long-term, transparency is part of the solution to identifying issues, but it does not necessarily lead to improvements. Solutions that tackle the root issues still need to be implemented, sustained, and managed.</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c12" id="h.tyjcwt"><span class="c17">HOUSING</span></h2><p class="c3"><span class="c0">4.

An oversight structure would be beneficial, such as a tracking system to document when a landlord looking to sell sends the TOPA notice to affected tenants. This will help make sure tenants have enough time to review. If English is not the tenants&#39; first language, they should be given the materials in their native language.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">5.

In developing a limit, we need to strike a balance in giving an elected official enough time to develop policies and making an impact, and documenting and transitioning institutional knowledge.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">7. Do you support abolishing Constituent Service Funds and replacing them with appropriated funds to serve resident needs? If not, explain.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Constituent Service Funds were designed to service resident needs. I don&#39;t believe the immediate step is to abolish Constituent Service Funds. However, we must make sure they&#39;re put to the appropriate uses, and serving residents&rsquo; needs.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">8.

What role the does DC Council play during the Ballot initiative process? </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">As the Campaign Finance Amendment Act of 2001 states, DC Council may not expend taxpayer funds or use public resources to advocate for the passage or defeat of an initiative.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Where DC Council disagrees with initaitives that qualify for the ballot and are subsequently voted on and passed by the people, the Council should respect the people&rsquo;s vote, and, where there is disagreement, there should be discussion on a roadmap forward.</span></p><h2 class="c12" id="h.1t3h5sf"><span class="c17">CRIMINAL JUSTICE</span></h2><p class="c3"><span class="c0">11.

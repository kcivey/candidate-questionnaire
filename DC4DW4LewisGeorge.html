This chart (source: </span><span class="c0"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://itep.org/whopays/washington-dc/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573312361558000">https://itep.org/whopays/washington-dc/</a></span><span class="c2">) shows the current tax structure for DC households (including sales, property, and income taxes). Do you think this is a fair tax structure? If so, explain why. If not, explain why and how you would improve it.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>No, I do not think the current tax structure is fair because it effectively treats families living pay-check to pay-check the same as wealthier families when considering the regressive impacts of sales and property taxes. Under the current tax structure families with incomes just above $23,600 a year pay the same share of their income &mdash;&nbsp;between 9 percent and 10 percent&mdash;in combined income, sales, and property taxes as the District&rsquo;s wealthiest residents. Yet, sales taxes and property taxes impact these families differently. Sales taxes amount to a larger share of a postal worker&rsquo;s wages than a law firm partner&rsquo;s earnings. And when landlords choose to pass the cost of property taxes on to their renters, the negative financial impact is greater on people with lower incomes. One way I would like to reduce the disparate impact caused by our current tax structure is to raise the top rates on our highest-income households who already get big federal tax breaks. We should increase the tax rates on the brackets that cover the three-hundred-and fifty-thousandth dollar earned to the one-millionth dollar earned ($350k-$1M) and also the $1M+ bracket. We should also add a $3M+ bracket. Anyone in those brackets would still benefit from the lower rates on their first $350k of taxable income earned each year. </span><span class="c7">I will advocate for an increase in The District&rsquo;s Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) which assists residents who work but have low earnings through a refundable income tax credit and advocate for an increase in DC&rsquo;s Schedule H, which provides direct assistance with property taxes and rent. </span><span class="c1">We all agree that taxation without representation is wrong. We should also be outraged with tax breaks that only benefit corporations and the wealthiest residents. DC is notorious for nickel-and-diming working families with fees and fines while failing to enforce the same rules against high-income, well-connected residents, and large businesses. At a time when there is a steadily growing income gap and we shouldn&rsquo;t be funding our programs on the backs of those who need them, but rather the District should be asking its wealthiest residents to pay their fair share to address the city&rsquo;s inequities. </span></p><h2 class="c12" id="h.3znysh7"><span class="c19">WORKERS&rsquo; RIGHTS</span></h2><p class="c3"><span class="c15">2. DC has a proud history of passing landmark labor laws but a lackluster record of enforcing these laws or proactively informing workers about existing or new rights. What will you do as a CM to change this status quo and ensure there is strong oversight &amp; enforcement of worker rights?</span><span class="c1"><br><br>In DC, people should have access to jobs where they are treated with respect, have security if they work hard and well, and be able to provide for themselves and others. Workers should get a fair share of the results of their work. They should receive fair treatment and their work should be free from discrimination. </span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">There&rsquo;s a lot we can do to better protect workers, inform them of their rights, and expand the rights they have.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>When DC workers earn wages, in too many cases, some of their earnings are stolen by their employers. As Councilmember, I will actively oversee the fight against wage theft. DC has some of the best protections to prevent wage theft in the country but enforcement is lackluster and inconsistent. The current Attorney General often goes after bad actors but the DC Department of Employment Services, which should be the leader in this area, shows little urgency and often falls down on the job. </span><span class="c7 c23">Creating an independent labor agency could improve enforcement since it&#39;s not DOES&#39;s primary concern (working WITH employers is). Further, active Council oversight of the new agency would motivate it to be proactive in making sure employers everywhere follow the law.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c7 c24 c35"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">As Councilmember, I will introduce legislation to better protect workers who report retaliation. I will also fund a worker outreach initiative to ensure eligible employees and employers in Ward 4 are aware of their rights and responsibilities under PFL, ASSLA, and wage laws. As Councilmember, I will introduce legislation to adopt the U.S. Department of Labor&rsquo;s Obama-era overtime pay threshold to make some salaried workers who make less than $47,000 per year receive overtime pay if they work more than 40 hours a week. </span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">If you perform work for a large corporation, you should be guaranteed a minimum wage. Studies have shown that Uber and Lyft drivers in DC sometimes make $5 an hour or less. As Councilmember, I&rsquo;ll introduce legislation following California&rsquo;s example and prohibit employers from misclassifying drivers as freelancers who are exempt from minimum wage laws. </span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">All workers should be able to plan their lives, manage childcare, and arrange transportation without the risk of losing their jobs. As Councilmember, I will work to adopt Fair Scheduling legislation that would require employers to set employees&rsquo; schedules in advance and let workers who want to be full time get full time hours. <br><br>When DC subsidizes businesses to hire or train workers and that business fails to uphold its end of the bargain, DC should take that money back. As Councilmember, I&rsquo;ll make sure it happens. I will also require developers that are subsidized by the city and contractors with city contracts to pay wages that allow their workers to afford to live in DC.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">As Councilmember, I will work to establish a legal market for marijuana that prioritizes entrepreneurial opportunities, licensing, and certification for people of color and returning citizens in Ward 4.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">As Councilmember, I will make sure every worker in the District is covered by the DC Paid Family Leave program. And I won&rsquo;t stop fighting for the fundamental rights of tipped-wage workers &mdash; no matter how much the Council is in the pocket of industry lobbyists.<br><br>Small businesses are an important part of our economy, but in a gentrifying city they also face rising costs. As Councilmember, I will explore the creation of a small business rent control or assistance program to ensure the businesses we cherish most can keep their doors open.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Finally, every DC student should be supported as they enter the job market. As Councilmember, I will expand funding for the Marion S. Barry Summer Youth Program and implement in-school enrollment. I will also work to establish a utilities and infrastructure modernization program and link this effort to a reinvigorated vocational program in our schools as well as DC&rsquo;s bold emissions targets. </span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c21 c11 c24"></span></p><h2 class="c12" id="h.2et92p0"><span class="c19">EDUCATION</span></h2><p class="c4"><span class="c2">3. Publicly funded charter schools do not have the same transparency requirements as traditional DCPS schools including disclosing salaries, records, or vendor contracts less than $100,000 nor are charter schools required to have open meetings. Charter advocates argue that they lack the budget to comply with FOIA requests while open government advocates and parents want more access to information. Do you believe charters should be subject to FOIA? How would you resolve these opposing stances on charter school transparency? </span></p><p class="c4"><span>Educating our young people is one of the most solemn and important responsibilities a person or organization can be trusted with. Any school must have transparency and accountability commensurate with that responsibility. Publicly funded </span><span class="c7">charter schools in DC must be subject to FOIA and all other transparency requirements that apply to DC&rsquo;s public schools </span><span>to ensure the safety and quality of education for students.</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;The current status quo - unaccountable charter schools that beg poverty on the one hand while paying exorbitant salaries to executives on the other hand and sending hefty management fees out-of-state, often to for-profit companies- is a symptom of a charter system that has been allowed access to our city&rsquo;s children, and tax dollars, without even the most basic checks and balances. As Ward 4 Councilmember, I would make full transparency and accountability for charter schools a top legislative priority.</span><span class="c7 c15">&nbsp;</span><span class="c7">Also, I think any school receiving public funds should be required to agree to labor neutrality. Public money should never be used for anti-union activities as has happened in the past. Our education resources are precious and should be going to supplies, teachers, staff, leaders, and education tools, not union busting firms. </span></p><h2 class="c12" id="h.tyjcwt"><span class="c19">HOUSING</span></h2><p class="c4"><span class="c15">4. DC4D has joined the Reclaim Rent Control coalition, which advocates for expanding rent control. Do you support their </span><span class="c0"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://reclaimrentcontrol.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Rent-Control-Policy-One-Pager.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573312361562000">platform</a></span><span class="c2">&nbsp;in its entirety? If not, explain where you differ. What other ideas would you propose to help residents who are negatively impacted by rising rents?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Rent control helps to preserve and protect housing for all renters. While it&rsquo;s critical to renew rent control, simply preserving the system we have now is not enough to ensure the housing security of hundreds of thousands of DC residents. Current loopholes in the law are allowing for landlords to impose massive rent hikes and push long-time residents out of their homes. I have witnessed many of my family members and friends, even those with good incomes be forced out of their homes as rent spiraled out of control. Many were pushed out of Ward 4 or DC altogether. We need the common-sense reforms proposed in the Reclaim Rent Control platform. Specifically, we need to extend rent control to 4-unit apartment buildings and buildings built before 2005. This and the other reforms outlined in the platform will have a major positive impact for the tenants of our city, stymying the mass displacement of long-time District residents.</span></p><p class="c4"><span>We need leaders that are not beholden to people who see housing merely as a profit center, not a basic right. We need to fully fund permanent supportive housing and targeted supportive housing for all families and individuals experiencing chronic homelessness, expand rent control, and drastically increase investment in programs like the Housing Production Trust Fund and the Local Rent Supplement Program. These programs are essential not only to the production and preservation of affordable housing, but to the stabilization of our communities. &nbsp;</span><span class="c7 c26">The success of these programs is not just dependent on the amount of money we invest in these programs, but the priorities that guide our allocation of these funds. We need to make sure the HPTF is preserving, as well as creating, housing for the poorest in our community (those making under 30% AMI). We need to support the creation and preservation of Limited Equity Co-ops, the most democratic housing solution we have. HPTF application approval process should be transparent and all rankings should be available to the public, so that we know </span><span class="c7 c20">how</span><span class="c18 c7">&nbsp;these dollars are spent, not just that they&#39;re a line item in our budget.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c15"><br><br>5. Our public housing tenants are facing a serious crisis, and we have little confidence in the DC Housing Authority&rsquo;s plan to &ldquo;reposition&rdquo; public housing. DC4D has endorsed a </span><span class="c0"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/demand-dc-housing-authority-to-preserve-public-housing-and-residents-rights&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573312361563000">petition </a></span><span class="c2">to DCHA with recommendations on protecting tenants. Have you signed the petition; if not, why not? What other policies would you propose to protect and/or expand public housing and housing for very low-income residents in DC?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Yes, I have signed the petition. I am a strong supporter of keeping public housing public. All progressive and social forms of housing should be used and expanded in DC to make our city a more affordable place to live. The policies that the District has pursued, including demolition of public housing and failing to build adequate new units to replace the lost housing stock, let alone meet demand, has resulted in displacement of far too many residents. In addition, DC has allowed our public housing stock to fall into severe disrepair, endangering the lives of the people who live there. Just because the federal government wants to abandon public housing residents, doesn&rsquo;t mean we should go along with it. We can&rsquo;t accept this trend as inevitable. As a Councilmember, I will work to appropriate and identify new sources of capital for our public housing developments and rehabilitation. </span></p><h2 class="c12" id="h.3dy6vkm"><span class="c19">GOVERNMENT/ETHICS</span></h2><p class="c4"><span class="c15">6. Are you participating in Fair Elections? If not, why not? What other ideas would you propose to limit the influence of money in politics?<br><br></span><span>Yes, I am extremely proud to be the first-ever Fair Elections candidate in Ward 4. I decided to run for this seat because I believe in making DC a place that works better for everyone and being a Fair Elections candidate is a fundamental part of that. The Fair Elections program strengthens our democracy and, as my campaign hopes to prove, has the potential to change the nature of our representation in the city and put power back in the hands of people who have been too often muted by corporate lobbyists and politicians beholden to them. There is more we need to do, however. The recent report documenting Jack Evans&rsquo; chronic and ongoing corruption shows that it&rsquo;s not just our campaigns and elections that need to change: it&rsquo;s how Councilmembers do or do not profit from the position of power they hold once in office. Prohibiting outside employment and campaign contributions from corporations that contract with the DC government is one option, but it&rsquo;s not a perfect solution. Creating a culture of accountability, where sitting members of Council are willing and able to vote out members who violate ethics regulations is another important part. My experience as Assistant Attorney General taught me that holding people accountable is challenging but absolutely necessary to making government work the way it&rsquo;s meant to.<br><br></span><span class="c2">7. Do you support abolishing Constituent Service Funds and replacing them with appropriated funds to serve resident needs? If not, explain.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Yes, I support abolishing the Constituent Service Funds. The CSF does not serve the people, it serves private interests. The system has created a backdoor channel for the wealthy and well connected to earn favor. I will not have a CSF as a councilmember and will propose to remove the fund for a more transparent system that will benefit all residents.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c15">8. Will you commit to vote for Vote16DC? </span><span>Yes, As a former Student Representative on the DC Board of Education and Youth Mayor for YMCA DC Youth and Government, I know firsthand that the earlier you get young people civically engaged the better! Extending voting rights to 16- and 17-year-olds in DC can go a long way to ensuring that the District&#39;s young people become engaged, lifelong voters and ensures they have a voice in the decisions that are impacting their lives. <br><br></span><span class="c2">9. Since DC frequently has races with many candidates in which the winner gets far less than a majority of the votes, would you support implementing ranked choice voting or some other method to ensure some level of majority support?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Yes, I support ranked choice voting. It is a proven and well-tested method for giving voters the power to elect the candidate(s) that best represent their interests. Democracy works best when voters have choices and can express their desired support for candidates fully. Too often, we have multiple candidates championing the ideas that matter but the way we vote limits our ability to show support for our favorite candidates. In addition, we label some candidates as spoilers and voters end up splitting their vote among like-minded candidates, opening the door for candidates opposed by a majority of voters to become elected. Instead of polarizing and divisive politics, we need to elevate the power of voters to elect a candidate that represents a broad base of voters and is the choice of a majority of the electorate. Ranked choice voting not only gives greater choice to voters and upholds democratic principles of majority rule, it alters the nature of political campaigns to be about the best ideas - not the biggest bank accounts or most polarized based. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">10. What role the does DC Council play during the Ballot initiative process? </span></p><p class="c4"><span>The DC Council&rsquo;s role in the ballot initiative process should be to listen to the will of the people, respect our votes, respect democracy and to vote down any proposal that would overturn the ballot outcome. As a candidate for Democratic State Committee, I supported Initiative 77. As a former restaurant worker, I support Initiative 77 and so did 45,00 plus DC residents especially from our predominantly African American neighborhoods. DC residents are already disenfranchised in Congress, so should not allow the will of a few to change the decision of a majority of residents.</span></p><h2 class="c12" id="h.1t3h5sf"><span class="c9">CRIMINAL JUSTICE</span></h2><p class="c4"><span class="c2">11. Do you support decriminalizing sex work? If not, explain how you would reduce the violence and exploitation currently suffered by these workers?</span></p><p class="c4"><span>Yes, I support decriminalization of sex work. This would allow sex workers to have an easier time accessing services, attaining stable housing, and perhaps deciding to transition to a new industry should it become preferable for them. It would also make it easier for people in the industry to report violence or other crimes they see or experience, and would make sex workers less vulnerable to coercion or exploitation by police officers. We should use our law enforcement resources to keep people safe. Our resources dedicated to sex-related matters should be more focused on matters of coercion, assault, other non-consensual sex, and sex between adults and minors. It just isn&rsquo;t a good use of our resources to focus on consensual sex between adults when we could be preventing non-consensual sex instead.<br><br></span><span class="c2">12. Do you support ending stop and frisk in DC?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c15"><br></span><span class="c1">As a former District Attorney and Assistant Attorney General, I know firsthand that if we want a safer city, we need to focus our law enforcement resources on tactics and strategies that work. We must move resources from programs that don&rsquo;t work to ones that do. Which is why I do not support stop and frisk. It doesn&rsquo;t keep people safe, it violates basic rights, and has been weaponized against black and brown communities.</span></p><p class="c4"><span>Though these types of stops were found legal</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;</span><span>in</span><span class="c30">&nbsp;Terry v. Ohio </span><span class="c1">(1968) we are under no obligation to use that tactic. Several cities similar to DC have studied the effectiveness of this tactic and the results don&rsquo;t indicate that the benefits exceed the costs (which are almost exclusively borne by people of color). </span></p><p class="c7 c37"><span class="c1">A study of the use of the tactic in New York between 2009-2012 found that just 0.3% of the 2.4 million stops resulted in a jail sentence longer than thirty days. Event fewer (just 0.1%) led to a violent crime conviction. </span></p><p class="c7 c16"><span>Studies indicate that use of the tactic in Baltimore, Philadelphia, Newark, New Jersey, and elsewhere all show that the vast majority (typically over 90%!) of people stopped are innocent. Most studies show that 90% or more of people stopped aren&rsquo;t even arrested, let alone guilty of anything. In fact, in New York, </span><span class="c38"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-proactive-policing-crime-20170925-story.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573312361565000">major crime complaints fell</a></span><span>&nbsp;when the NYPD took a break from proactive policing tactics, including stop and frisk.<br></span><span class="c33"><br></span><span class="c1">There isn&rsquo;t much evidence that Stop-and-Frisk works well. It widens the gap between communities and police and further exacerbates racial injustice, and other negative results. The practice has such disparate racial effects and exacerbates already difficult circumstances for longtime residents. Further, it costs resources that could be used for programs that have much stronger efficacy results, such as the Cure The Streets Violence Interrupters program.<br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">13. What public health policy ideas would you propose to reduce violence in DC?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">We need to take a public health and racial equity approach to public safety. As Councilmember, I will consider creating a non-police emergency response service of mental and behavioral health professionals (similar to CAHOOTS in Oregon). I will prioritize hiring counselors for every DC public school, at a reasonable ratio of students for every counselor. I will also prioritize hiring and sustaining community-based social workers who can proactively identify and begin to meet people&rsquo;s needs before underlying issues get to the point of violence.<br><br>I also believe that violence is often a symptom of broader social factors. My positions and policy proposals on other issues like housing, education, economic opportunity, transportation, nutrition, and the environment will all contribute to making our city more equal, more just, and to addressing the root causes that lead to violence. There is no one approach that will decrease violence. But by doing all we can to help our neighbors, we&rsquo;ll also help keep our city safe.<br><br><br>IMMIGRATION</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c15 c11 c21">14. Do you support legislation to prohibit the District from cooperating with federal immigration agencies, including by complying with detainer requests, absent a judicial warrant or order?</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Yes, D.C. considers itself a &ldquo;Sanctuary City.&rdquo; But as a former Assistant Attorney General,,,,, I know there is more work to be done to ensure that we truly provide sanctuary. The D.C. Department of Corrections has historically complied with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) notification requests. Specifically, when an inmate has an ICE detainer lodged against him/her, the DOC will notify ICE 48 hours prior to the expiration of their sentence, and in instances where an inmate is being released pursuant to a court order, DOC will notify ICE immediately to inform them that the inmate is being processed for release. ICE has no place on DC streets and no agency, employee or entity of the District Government should be cooperating with ICE including the DOC. As councilmember, I will work to close the current loophole which allows D.C. DOC to notify ICE regarding the residency and release of inmates and ensure that we can truly call ourselves &ldquo;a Sanctuary City.&rdquo; </span></p><h2 class="c12" id="h.4d34og8"><span class="c19">ENVIRONMENT</span></h2><p class="c4"><span class="c7 c15 c22">15. Given Pepco&rsquo;s resistance to transitioning to clean renewable energy, do you think DC would benefit from municipally owned electricity? If not, why?&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7">In its current form Pepco is privately owned, uses fossil fuels, and raises rates for no reason to rip people off, harm the environment, and make a profit. Pepco has a vested financial interest in the continued use of fossil fuels and nuclear energy and as such have opposed efforts to equitably transition DC to renewable energy. This model absolutely needs to change.<br><br></span><span>Last year, DC passed the strongest energy bill in the country, </span><span class="c17"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/dc-council-approves-ambitious-new-clean-energy-goals/2018/11/27/8f284830-f266-11e8-80d0-f7e1948d55f4_story.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573312361567000">mandating</a></span><span>&nbsp;the city&rsquo;s entire power grid convert to entirely renewable energy sources by 2032. In order to achieve this goal I believe that yes, </span><span class="c7">we need some form of public ownership of utilities. A municipally-owned electricity utility will allow the public to have more control over our energy generation and distribution. That way, the public can set (and reduce) rates and choose to only buy electricity that comes from renewable energy. Many other cities, including Chicago and San Francisco, are also currently considering whether and how to transition utilities to public ownership. I will look to those cities for additional lessons about how to make this process successful in DC. Public ownership of our energy means we can transition to renewables faster and reinvest profits into our communities and families, instead of paying them out to shareholders and corporate executives.</span><span class="c7 c26"><br></span><span class="c11"><br></span><span class="c15">16. What specific legislative initiatives will you introduce in Council Period 24 to protect DC from the effects of climate change?</span><span><br><br>In addition to DC&rsquo;s ambitious Clean Energy plans, we&rsquo;ve also set a </span><span class="c29"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://mayor.dc.gov/release/mayor-bowser-recognized-bold-climate-policies-district-wins-bloomberg-american-cities&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573312361567000">goal</a></span><span>&nbsp;of net-zero carbon buildings by 2050. We&rsquo;re incentivizing electric cars and solar panels in residential homes. All of these are the right direction to be headed as a city.<br><br>I believe a large part of the job description of Councilmember is oversight: making sure we as a city actually do what we say we&rsquo;re going to do. We&rsquo;ve introduced policies and created ambitious programs. Now we have to do it and we don&rsquo;t have time to spare.<br><br>As Councilmember, I will hold DC radically accountable to the goals we have set out to achieve. I will also consider strategies that go beyond our existing goals, including putting a price on carbon, mandating commercial building owners to get their properties to zero emissions, non-wired alternatives for renewables, requiring WMATA to commit to a date when they will transition to an all-electric fleet, continuing to expand DC&rsquo;s cycling and pedestrian infrastructure, holding Washington Gas to its commitment to evolve its business model, and restricting gas vehicles in DC&rsquo;s central business district. </span><span class="c26">I will require building owners and developers to make sure all new investment in our buildings, especially for affordable housing, is for efficient electric appliances like heat pumps and induction stoves through building codes and efficiency programs like the Sustainable Energy Utility and Green Bank. I will require the Public Service Commission to plan for an equitable and fair phase out of AltaGas infrastructure. And </span><span class="c1">I will look into getting DC to zero waste and ending our use of the incinerator in Lorton, VA, a community of color negatively impacted by that incinerator&rsquo;s existence.<br><br>The climate crisis will have reverberations throughout our economy so we must also take action in other areas. In Council Session 24, I will create education and job training programs to make sure historically marginalized communities can be part of the new, zero-carbon economy. When those jobs do get created, I will absolutely make sure they are good, union jobs. I will also reinforce DC&rsquo;s status as a sanctuary city so that as climate change destabilizes homes we can make space for people facing displacement elsewhere. As Councilmember, I will also make sure the way we achieve zero emissions is racially just, and that communities of color do not disproportionately bear the burden of any new facilities that are needed.<br></span></p><h2 class="c12" id="h.2s8eyo1"><span class="c19">HEALTH</span></h2><p class="c3"><span class="c2">17. The DC Council passed the landmark &ldquo;Birth to Three&rdquo; legislation providing universal child care at subsidized rates; however, they failed to fully fund it. Would solutions would you propose to create sustainable funding for the program?</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c18 c7">Fully funding the Birth to Three for All DC Act is part of how we help working parents participate more fully in the economy, help every student in DC excel, and invest in the people who will lead our city in the next generation. The importance of each of these means Birth to Three deserves a dedicated funding stream and as Councilmember, I will work to identify and redirect funds as well as identify new revenue sources to create that stream. One possible avenue is to advocate for a more progressive tax code, including a higher marginal tax rate for individuals with incomes above $350,000 and a property tax surcharge for homes worth $2 million or more. The Sugary Beverage Tax recently introduced by Councilmembers Cheh and Nadeau could generate $10 million for Birth to Three and as Councilmember I will work with them to improve and then enact that proposal. </span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c7 c18"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c18 c7">In addition, as Councilmember I will bring a close and thoughtful eye to DC&rsquo;s existing budget to ensure we&rsquo;re making the right choices about how to invest in District families, and not wasting or abusing public funds. As Councilmember, I will consider options like rescinding the Qualified High Technology Company tax credit, enforcing claw-backs when businesses receiving government dollars don&rsquo;t honor their agreements with the city, stopping our current over-investments in the events DC slush fund, and ending the Supermarket Tax Credit which has failed to deliver on its promise to solve food deserts in Wards 7 and 8. As I said at the DC for Democracy candidates forum in early October, I would also redirect some of DC&rsquo;s current budget for police into violence interruption and prevention programs, and Birth to Three could potentially be one of them.<br></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c18 c7">We can afford to fully fund this groundbreaking new law if DC&rsquo;s wealthiest residents make this important investment in all of our children. </span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c7 c24 c11 c26 c36"></span></p><h2 class="c12" id="h.17dp8vu"><span class="c19">BACKGROUND</span></h2><p class="c4"><span>18. </span><span class="c30">(Ward 2 challengers only)</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c15">Are you committed to removing the incumbent from office?

As Ward 4 Councilmember, I will regularly ask our Advisory Neighborhood Commissions and Neighborhood Associations for comments on legislation pending vote and convene a quarterly meeting with all ANC Chairs and neighborhood association presidents to hear what their residents are concerned about and create a Ward-wide network that works together. I will prioritize opening a Community Office, so that our neighbors with mobility challenges, small children, or busy work schedules don&rsquo;t need to come down to the Wilson Building to talk with their Councilmember. &nbsp;I will also hold standing office hours at that Community Office, so that residents know exactly where to find me.</span></p><div><p class="c5 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p></div></body></html>
